## Open Source projects

We use, develop and contribute to open source projects. We believe that the use of open source code in our projects gives our clients greater freedom of choice in their development partners while at the same time having the reassurance of our in-depth knowledge of and professional support for those products.

Both of these products are free and licensed under a permissive MIT open-source license, allowing them to be used in commercial and open-source applications alike. Community support is available via the projects' respective GitHub issue trackers and [commercial support](/support "Networked Planet support options") is available from Networked Planet.

## dotNetRDF

dotNetRDF is...

* A complete library for parsing, managing, querying and writing RDF.
* A common .NET API for working with RDF triple stores such as AllegroGraph, Jena, Stardog and Virtuoso.
* A suite of command-line and GUI tools for working with RDF under Windows

## BrightstarDB

BrightstarDB is...
