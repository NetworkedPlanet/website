Open data is data published by organizations, governments and individuals with a license that enables free reuse. A wide variety of open data is already available, from international development statistics to local bus timetables.

Open data potentially provides valuable context and extensions to your data, but to get the best value from it you need to understand how to choose the right open data and how to integrate it effectively with your own data. This involves technical, legal and procedural challenges that we can guide you through.
