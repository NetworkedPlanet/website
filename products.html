               <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>We use, develop and contribute to open source projects. We believe that the use of open source code
                in our projects gives our clients greater freedom of choice in their development partners while at the
                same time having the reassurance of our in-depth knowledge of and professional support for those products.
            </p>
            <h2>Standards</h2>
            <p>NetworkedPlanet has always been focussed on developing software solutions that are built on international
                standards from organisations such as ISO and W3C. These world-wide, non-proprietary standards
                give the greatest assurance of interoperability and data portability.
