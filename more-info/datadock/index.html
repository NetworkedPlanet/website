                <p><a href="/blog/2015/08/10/opening-up-your-data.html">Publishing data shouldn't cost the earth</a>, but that there are some technical challenges to be faced when we want that data to be discoverable, accessible and usable.</p>

                <p>Of course, technical challenges mean resource challenges; even when data publishing software is free or open-source, it can mean that you require someone with the technical know-how to set it all up (and keep it running), and the resources to run the server to hold the software. In so many cases, these technical and resource challenges basically block individuals and smaller organisations from being able to publish data effectively or at all.</p>

                <p>We believe that taking your first steps in publishing your data shouldn't be this hard. We have the technical skills and expertise in data publishing standards to be able to provide that publishing service in a way that eliminates those barriers.</p>

                <p class="lead text-center"><a href="http://datadock.io" class="highlight" title="DataDock.io management portal">DataDock.io</a> is a <span class="highlight">free</span>, <span class="highlight">cloud-hosted</span>, <span class="highlight">standards-compliant</span> data publishing service that makes it easy for you to create your own data portal for <span class="highlight">unlimited datasets</span> in a matter of minutes.</p>
