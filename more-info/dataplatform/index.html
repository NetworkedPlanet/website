               <p>We've used our <a href="/about-us/#history">years of experience</a> creating enterprise level information management systems to create Web of Data, standards-compliant tools that can be used to connect and share data within organisations and between partners, as well as to publish data for public consumption.</p>

It allows you to choose which data are <span class="highlight">private</span>, which can be <span class="highlight">shared</span> with trusted partners, and for those that are <span class="highlight">public</span>, it publishes them on the Web of Data.</p>            </div>

                    <dd>Different job roles require different interactions with your data, the Data Platform interfaces are themselves shape-driven, enabling you to set up different views of your data depending on the access level and requirements of those who work with your data.</dd>

                    <dt>Standards-compliant</dt>
                    <dd>Your data does not get locked into proprietary formats, meaning you can move your data more easily should your software needs change in the future.</dd>

                    <dt>Schema-free</dt>
                    <dd>Configure your data storage to the shapes that fit your business. Add extra properties to your data in the future without having to bring in expensive developers to allow you to do so.</dd>

                    <dt>Connect the dots in your data</dt>
                    <dd>Relationships between data entities are as important as the data describing the entities themselves, keep track of how your data entities relate to one another to provide richer searching and navigational power to your interfaces.</dd>

                    <dt>Custom integration</dt>
                    <dd>We work with you to devise the best way to integrate with your existing systems, whether that entails custom automated workflows, scheduled jobs, integration with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) systems, or porting of legacy data into newer, standards-compliant formats.</dd>

                    <dt>Web-scale collaboration</dt>
                    <dd>Collaborate at a data level with partners across the globe by configuring any dataset to use your agreed-upon data standard.</dd>

                    <dt>Cloud based or server</dt>
                    <dd>We can provide the Data Platform suite either as a hosted solution, or as a Platform As A Service, depending on which is best suited to your needs and budget.</dd>
