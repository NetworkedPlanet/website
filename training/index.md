## Linked Data Training

At NetworkedPlanet we have authored a Linked Data training syllabus for those who are currently working with Linked Data, or are about to undertake projects that involve Linked Data.

Our Linked Data Professional Development Course consists of five modules taking the learner through all the key concepts of Linked Data, starting with basic concepts and progressing to in-depth theory and tutorials on the finer elements of working with Linked Data.

Our focus is on making sure each learner completes the course confident in their understanding of the fundamentals, and with new skills to be able to implement their training straight away.
