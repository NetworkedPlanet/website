<p class="lead">Our content management system integrations make it possible to link together the conceptual model with documents, web pages, images and other content stored in content management systems such as SharePoint and EPiServer.</p>

<p>NetworkedPlanet solutions are built on Topic Maps, an ISO standard for knowledge representation but also integrate some of the best features of the W3C Semantic Web stack such as RDF and SPARQL. Our solutions provide open import and export in a variety of standard formats and enable open Linked Data access so valuable knowledge is never locked in proprietary systems and is easily accessible to internal or external applications.</p>

<p>Our customers have used our products to make intranet solutions more effective, to help front-line workers find relevant information more quickly, and to produce complex concept-driven web-sites.</p>
