        <p class="lead"><a href="http://brightstardb.com">BrightstarDB</a> was created with the goal of making the benefits of the flexible, schema-free RDF model available to .NET developers in an easy-to-use persistent store. It is cross-platform, standards-compliant, compact, embeddable, and free to use for commercial and non-commercial applications alike.

<h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>BrightstarDB is, at its core, an RDF data store capable of handling millions of RDF triples; but unlike many other stores, BrightstarDB does not force the programmer to use an unfamiliar RDF-based API (although the RDF model and SPARQL queries are there if you want them). Instead we built two layers on top; one that enables the use of .NET's dynamic objects for retrieval and update; and another that provides a full "contract-first" entity model allowing you to define an application's domain model as .NET interfaces with minimal annotation and then use LINQ to query the data store and a context object pattern that will be familiar to users of the .NET Entity Framework for entity creation and update operations.</p>
        
        <p>BrightstarDB is fully open-source and licensed under the permissive MIT license. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/BrightstarDB/brightstardb">hosted on GitHub</a>, and project binaries are available from our <a href="http://brightstardb.codeplex.com/">CodeProject homepage</a> or via NuGet.</p>
        
<h3>Key Features</h3>

    <p><strong>Schema-free data store</strong>: BrightstarDB implements the RDF graph model which enables the storage of data of almost any shape. It gives the developer unprecedented freedom to evolve an application data model or even to combine multiple overlapping application data models into the same persistent store.</p>

    <p><strong>Contract-first Entity Framework</strong>: For many .NET developers it is much more comfortable to work with an application-specific data model and LINQ. This is particularly true when building MVC-style applications. BrightstarDB supports this by allowing an application data model to be defined as a set of .NET interfaces from which the concrete classes are automatically generated. Because of the schema-free nature of BrightstarDB an application data model can reflect all or just a part of the data managed in a BrightstarDB store; in this way multiple applications can concurrently use the same BrightstarDB store with each having its own application-specific view of the data.</p>

    <p><strong>RESTful server</strong>: BrightstarDB comes with its own server built on the awesome <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">Nancy Framework</a>. The server implements all of the key RDF/SPARQL endpoint standards for query, update and RDF graph manipulation; as well as an extended API for transactional operations. The REST interface means it is possible to interact with BrightstarDB from almost any programming language. You can run the server as a standalone-application; as a Windows Service; or embedded into IIS, Nginx or any OWIN-compliant host.</p>

<p><strong>Embeddable database</strong>: BrightstarDB can also be run within an application as an embedded database, making it ideal for desktop and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Platform</strong>: The embedded version can also run under Windows Phone, iOS and Android. The embedded version and the RESTful server runs under both .NET and Mono and the database files are portable between versions.</p>
<p><strong>Latest RDF Standards Support</strong>: BrightstarDB builds on the <a href="http://www.dotnetrdf.org/">dotNetRDF</a> library which enables us to support a wide variety of RDF import and export syntaxes as well as SPARQL 1.1 Query and Update.</p>
