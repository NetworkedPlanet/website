NetworkedPlanet can provide your organization with the help and support necessary to kick-start the process of building a domain knowledge model. Our approach focuses on getting the details about the domain out of the heads of the domain experts and into a form that can be expressed visually and clearly documented as a first step to building a knowledge structure. This approach is independent of any final implementation (whether it is with NetworkedPlanetâ€™s tools or with other tools).
