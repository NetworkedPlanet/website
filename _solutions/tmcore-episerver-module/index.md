The TMCore EPiServer Module adds concept-based findability and navigation to the award-winning EPiServer Web Content Management System. Site navigation and content classification can be entirely driven from topic map structures defined by the site architect. The EPiServer Module also provides ASP.NET components that can be quickly integrated into EPiServer content templates, bringing the power of concept-based navigation and search directly to the end-users.

The TMCore EPiServer Module is a based on the [TMCore Topic Map Engine](/solutions/tmcore/) and EPiServer CMS engine and is a feature-rich and robust enterprise classification, navigation and search technology that adds Topic Map capability to any EPiServer solution.

This module allows content to be classified into a Topic Map. A Topic Map is a collection of related topics that together form an information model. These topics can be related to other topics that are relevant to search and navigation for a particular site. In the delivery environment this classification information can be used to create related links between conceptually similar documents, alternative navigation paths, content from other servers, and classified search results.

The TMCore EPiServer Module provides a way to conceptually organize and connect content across one or more web sites and back-end information systems. This allows users to have a single point of access to all information about a given subject or topic regardless of where the information is stored. Topic-based content organization maximizes the ability to deliver key information to a user, and enables better targeting and re-use of content.

As topics can be connected to each other in many different ways it is possible to provide users with different navigation paths to reach the same document. The TMCore EPiServer Module allows users to navigate information in the same way they think about it. This is a huge improvement over poorly maintained manual links and a single navigation hierarchy.

TMCore works seamlessly with EPiServer, whether on web sites, portals or intranets. The key to the integration between TMCore and EPiServer is .NET technology and the power and versatility of the TMCore product and Topic Map model. In addition to providing integrated search, the TMCore EPiServer Module supports the security, workflow and personalization models of EPiServer
