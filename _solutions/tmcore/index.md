TMCore is the premiere toolkit for developers on .NET looking to harness the full power of Topic Maps in their applications. Built from the ground-up using .NET technologies, TMCore provides a flexible set of APIs and builds on the robustness, scalability, performance of Microsoftâ€™s SQL Server.

TMCore allows developers to take full advantage of the power of topic maps in their applications. The engine provides a robust store for multiple topic maps; an extensive API accessible via any language supported by the Microsoft CLR; and a high-level web services interface that allows both reading and updating of topic maps using SOAP-based web service calls.

The engine makes use of Microsoft SQLServer to provide scalable, persistent storage and is designed to allow multiple instances to access the same data store simultaneously using an optimistic locking strategy to minimize development overhead.
