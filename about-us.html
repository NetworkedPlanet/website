            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>Founded in 2004, NetworkedPlanet was established to develop Semantic Web software with a focus on helping businesses to manage and publish domain knowledge and content. After spending 12 years focusing only on enterprise level solutions, we expanded our product range to include offerings that would give organisations of any size who are publishing data the ability to "level up" and connect to the global <a href="/blog/2017/03/01/connecting-the-dots.html">Web of Data</a>.
            </p>
            <p>We have a variety of technical solutions, libraries and toolkits as well as building bespoke software for clients. Wherever possible we try to <a href="/open-source" title="Networked Planet open source projects">open-source our tech</a> or <a href="/free-open-data-publishing" title="DataDock has free accounts for publishing open data">offer it for free</a>. For businesses who would like to use open-source software but require the peace of mind that comes with a support and maintenance contract, we offer <a href="/support" title="support contract options">technical support contracts specifically for those products</a>.</p>

            <p>We also offer <a href="/consultancy" title="Linked Data consultancy">consultancy on projects of all sizes</a>, and <a href="/training" title="Linked Data training">training</a> for those working with or about to work with <a href="/linked-data" title="Linked Data explained">Linked Data</a>. We offer a reduced day rate for not-for-profit organisations and charities.</p>
