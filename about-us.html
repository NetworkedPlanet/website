            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>Founded in 2004, NetworkedPlanet was established to develop Semantic Web software with a focus on helping businesses to manage and publish domain knowledge and content. After spending 12 years focusing only on enterprise level solutions, we expanded our product range to include offerings that would give organisations of any size who are publishing data the ability to "level up" and connect to the global <a href="/blog/2017/03/01/connecting-the-dots.html">Web of Data</a>.
            </p>
            <p>We have a variety of technical solutions, libraries and toolkits as well as building bespoke software for clients. Wherever possible we try to open-source our tech or offer it for free, for example:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="http://datadock.io">DataDock.io</a></dt>
                <dd>A free cloud-hosted Web of Data publishing platform, using Linked Data & CSVW web standards</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www.dotnetrdf.org/">dotNetRDF</a></dt>
                <dd>An Open Source .NET Library for RDF</dd>

            </dl>
            <p>We also offer consultancy on projects of all sizes. We offer a reduced day rate for not-for-profit organisations and charities.</p>
