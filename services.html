                Many organisations collect and store a lot of information without using it to its full potential. Most of these organisations are also aware of this, but are unsure what to do about it. At first glance it can seem like a massive undertaking!
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-center">Networked Planet helps you through this process.</p>

                <h2>Identify</h2>
                <p class="text-justify-lg">First, we chat with you about what your requirements are, and what type of data you hold. We help you identify which parts of your data can be shared and which would be most useful to share.</p>

                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p class="text-justify-lg">To be effectively used, data needs to be properly structured; we help you look at your existing stores of data, how it should be structured, and what (if any) changes can be made to the way you gather that information that will streamline the process in the future.</p>

                <h2>Publish</h2>
                <p class="text-justify-lg">Your newly structured data can then be published internally, making the data accessible to everyone in your organisation enabling new insights and encouraging innovation. But it doesn’t have to stop there - publishing one dataset inevitably leads to requests for another one to be published too. We can ensure that you develop skills internally to maintain and expand your published datasets.</p>

                <h2>Connect</h2>
                <p class="text-justify-lg">For super awesome über coolness, you can choose to publish Linked Open Data, bringing developers, researchers, data scientists and journalists to your data portal to reuse and combine your data with other publicly available data sets, inspiring ideas and enabling new discoveries that would not have been possible before.</p>
