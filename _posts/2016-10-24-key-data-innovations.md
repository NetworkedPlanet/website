Charity leaders will learn about data protection and how to lead organisations toward better collection and use of data at our workshop at the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in London on the 10th of November. 

We will review and explore data protection and privacy laws to gain a comfort level that allows participants to lead, wisely, onward, before we delve into new priorities for data collection and use.

This will be a true workshop, allowing participants to gain a solid footing on issues that often result in wasted time and energy at charities. The goal is to equip leaders to empower their staff toward the big goals of the organisation - making major gains in efforts to create a better world.
