13/02/2009, NetworkedPlanet are pleased to annouce the release of version 3.1 of the TMCore SharePoint Module.

The TMCore SharePoint Module is a tight integration between Microsoft SharePoint and the TMCore information management server that greatly improves the way information is organised, classified and located with Microsoft SharePoint solutions.

This new release sees a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, but more significantly it includes a number of features that have been requested by our customers including support for paged faceted search results and some new facet selectors for faceted search; more flexible auto-classification schemes; and the ability to filter and sort SharePoint lists by the classification information attached to the list items.

The new version is available as an upgrade for all customers with a current maintenance contract. For more information and download details please <a href="mailto:contact@networkedplanet.com">email us</a>.
