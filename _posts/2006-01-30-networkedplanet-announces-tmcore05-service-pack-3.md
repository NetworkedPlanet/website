NetworkedPlanet is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the Service Pack 3 of TMCore05, the toolkit for developing topic map applications for Microsoft .NET.

Service Pack 3 is primarily focused on performance enhancements with additional database indexing and improved internals boosting the performance of many applications including Networked Planet's TMCore SharePoint Module and TMCore EPiServer Module.

For developers, Service Pack 3 is backwards compatible with Service Pack 2 and existing code can run on this new version without any changes or a need to recompile. For database managers, the Service Pack 3 distribution includes a script to migrate data from a Service Pack 2 database.

TMCore05 Service Pack 3 is now available in Full, Lite and Developers' Editions and is a recommended upgrade for all customers.
