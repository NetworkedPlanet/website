NetworkedPlanet's Graham Moore and Kal Ahmed have contributed some new articles to the Microsoft Architecture Journal on the subject of topic maps and topic map applications.

The <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/2005/issue5/Jour5Intro/">first article</a> appears in Journal5 and provides a general overview of the concepts behind topic maps; how those concepts are implemented in the XTM syntax; and how patterns can be applied to topic maps to create reusable application components.

The <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/2006/issue6/Jour6TopicMaps/default.aspx">second article</a> appears in Journal6 and discusses how topic maps can be applied in a number of different application scenarios including intranet and internet content management. This article also discusses the use of Web Services for integration of topic map data into wider application architectures.

These articles are also archived in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj5intro.asp">Microsoft MSDN site</a>.

You can subscribe to the print edition of the Architecture Journal and download translations in Spanish and Portuguese from <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/">the Architecture Journal home page</a>.

To accompany the second article, Kal has recorded a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=150161">podcast interview with Ron Jacobs</a> on MSDN's Channel 9 site. You can hear Kal and Ron discuss how topic maps can contribute to a wide range of applications and architectures.
