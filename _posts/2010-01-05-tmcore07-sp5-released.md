NetworkedPlanet today announces the release of latest version of the TMCore topic map engine. TMCore is the premiere toolkit for developers on .NET looking to harness the full power of Topic Maps in their applications. Built from the ground-up using .NET technologies, TMCore provides a flexible set of APIs and builds on the robustness, scalability, performance of Microsoft's SQL Server.



The new SP5 release of TMCore07 fixes a packaging issue found with the SP4 release that may prevent the faceted search features of the TMCore SharePoint Module from working correctly. Customers having a current support contract or currently evaluating TMCore may receive TMCore07 SP5 free of charge.
