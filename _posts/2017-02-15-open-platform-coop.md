> By providing a viable alternative to the standard internet business model based on monopoly and extraction, platform cooperatives provide a template for a new type of organisation â€“ forming the building blocks for a new economy. 

I'm very much looking forward to Open:2017 which is being held tomorrow and Friday at Goldsmiths in South London. The subjects of the various sessions looks so interesting I think I'll find it difficult to choose what to attend!

I'm on a few of the panels, so at least I know a few of the subjects that I'll get to participate in discussions about. I was very happy to hear from the organisers that they are fighting hard to avoid "Death By Powerpoint", so expect panels and discussions and audience discussion instead of a single person droning on at you for an hour.
 
 My sessions are:
 
### From data slaves to data citizens
 
 Thursday 4:15pm
 
### Linked open data for the solidarity economy
 
 Friday 11:20am
 
### Working session: Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem
 
 Friday 2pm
 
 If you want to know more, [this blogpost introducing the concept of platform cooperatives](https://open.coop/2016/12/02/introduction-platform-co-ops/) is a great starting point, and you can see the [full programme here](https://2017.open.coop/programme/).
