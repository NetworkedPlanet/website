Today we release a new version of the popular TMCore EPiServer Module built specifically for the new EPiServer CMS 7.



The TMCore EPiServer Module extends EPiServer CMS 7 with several key abilities:

<ul>

	<li>Link site content to a domain knowledge model consisting of a network of related concepts.</li>

	<li>Create bidirectional, semantic links between pages.</li>

	<li>Create conceptual "hub" pages that provide a single point of entry for all information relating to a particular concept.</li>

</ul>



This new version of the TMCore EPiServer Module provides an editing environment that is integrated into the new CMS 7 editor as well as providing backwards compatibility with the editing environment carried over from CMS 6.
