Version 1.1 of Concepts for SharePoint is now available. This package addresses a small number of bugs and enhancements. The full change list and upgrade instructions can be found below.



This update is available to all customers with a valid support contract. Please contact support@networkedplanet.com for a download link.



<strong>Upgrading from 1.0</strong>

------------------



To upgrade from 1.0, unzip the  download package and run the STSADM -upgradesolution command.Â  The exact  command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but  will be similar to:



stsadm -o upgradesolution -name  ConceptsForSharePoint.wsp -filename ConceptsForSharePoint.wsp  -allowgacdeployment -local



Restart IIS and the SharePoint 2010 Timer  Service



If running CfS on a separate server to that of the Web3 Platform,  you will also need to upgrade the additional web3.wsp file contained in the  upgrade package and restart the services.
