Concepts for EPiServer 1.1.4 is now available for download.

<ul>

	<li>This version fixes a specific issue where the module would prevent page saving when the module is not yet configured for a topic map. The module now ignores PageSaved events unless there is a valid topic map configured that can be connected to.</li>

</ul>
