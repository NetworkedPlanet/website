We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of new releases of TMCore07 and the TMCore EPiServer Module.



The new TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 release supports EPiServer CMS 7.5 bringing the power of concept-based findability and navigation to EPiServer sites. The tightly integrated topic editor component makes it easy for editors to create relationships between pages as part of the normal page edit / update cycle and an extensive API allows developers to create uniquely flexible site navigation of related pages and related concepts. Please note that this release is compatible only with EPiServer CMS 7.5 - customers on older versions of the EPiServer CMS do not need to upgrade at this time.



The TMCore07 SP7 release has been issued in tandem with the TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 release. This release includes some minor bug fixes plus compatibility fixes to enable newer browsers to access all of the features of the TMEditor web application. This is a recommended upgrade for all TMCore users.



Both the TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 and TMCore07 SP7 are available now to customers with an active support and maintenance contract - please <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/" title="Contact">contact us</a> for download and upgrade details.
