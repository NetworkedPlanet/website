We are pleased to announce our first training webinar, "Introduction to RDF and SPARQL". As the name suggests,
this is a short (1 hour) introduction to the fundamental technologies behind Linked Open Data. RDF is the 
defacto standard format for publishing Linked Data and SPARQL is the primary query language used with RDF
data. The webinar aims to give you an overview of the basic principles behind RDF and SPARQL to kickstart
your learning about these technologies.

The webinar will be presented by Kal Ahmed who in addition to being the founder of NetworkedPlanet is also
the lead developer of [BrightstarDB](http://brightstardb.com/).

This webinar is FREE, but places are limited.
