We are delighted to announce the 1.0 release of the [Data Platform](http://dataplatform.co.uk/). The Data Platform fulfils the need of an easy-to-use interface for managing and publishing datasets, without limiting the number of datasets or requests to the data you publish, and publishing standards-compliant, 5-star Linked Open Data. 

Every organisation is different when it comes to managing the data they hold, here at NetworkedPlanet we can chat with you about the different types of data you manage, identify which parts are suitable for publishing as Open Data and outline the best processes to implement so that your organisation can be linked into the Web of Data.

### New to Linked Open Data?

We run a [regular webinar series](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/networkedplanet-limited-8359397016) about the basics of Linked Open Data, and also host private webinars for organisations interested in learning more about the Data Platform.
