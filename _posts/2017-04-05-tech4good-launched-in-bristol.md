Back in June last year, I attended [VCSSCamp](https://vcsscamp.wordpress.com/) in Birmingham and heard about the network of NetSquared "Tech for Good" meetups from Paul Webster, UK&EU XXXXXXX. Paul explained to me that NetSquared supported people who wanted to set up Tech for Good meetups in their home locations, by providing mentoring, support and advice as well as the financial supprt to cover the meetup.com fees, all that was needed was some enthusiasm and enough spare time to volunteer to plan, organise and host the meetups themselves.

 After a bit of serious thought regarding how much time I could donate myself, and also chatting to a couple of people who I thought would be perfect co-organisers for this type of meetup group and getting positive responses back, I got back in touch with Paul who in turn e-introduced me to Eli van der Giessen, who heads up the global network from their base in Vancouver. Tech4Good Bristol was born! Coming on board to be the Tech4Good Bristol core organising team were [Helen Woodcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenwoodcock/), [Ed Howarth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-howarth-74136178/) and [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrpwilliams/) (of course).
