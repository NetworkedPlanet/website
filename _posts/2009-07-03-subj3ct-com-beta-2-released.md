We have just refreshed Subj3ct.com with Beta 2. We have tried to incorporate the feedback we have had as well as adding some things we think are useful. The highlights are:

* Support for OpenID for signing in

* Ability to create and publish identifiers and indicator pages from with the Subj3ct portal

* A changes feed that can be used to aggregate whats happening in Subj3ct

* Embeddable snippets (RDFa, SKOS etc) on each subject record page that can be used to tag a page with a given subject.

* The start of a user community that currently supports user search

* Ability to process SKOS feeds

* Ability to register feeds without creating an account (this allows users to reference existing SKOS vocabularies that they don't own)

* Updated statistics on the home page and quick links to most recent subjects and some random subjects.

* Bug fixes and performance improvements

We now have 3180 identifiers in 23 feeds and we and others are adding to this all the time.

More stuff to come...
