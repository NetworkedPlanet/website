We have just added a new page to the site detailing the pricing levels for <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/support/brightstardb-support/" title="BrightstarDB Support">commercial BrightstarDB support</a>. 

<!--more-->

We have tried to provide a cost-effective support offering that can suit small teams and scale up to encompass larger teams. Our basic support is charged per named contact rather than per developer in your team - so if you have 10 developers in the team but only two working on the BrightstarDB back-end, then you only need two named contacts on your support contract or you can opt to have just one of the developers as a support contact.



At the high-end of the support offerings we have our extended support program which adds a number of hours of consultancy or bespoke development to the package.



For full details, please go to the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/support/brightstardb-support/" title="BrightstarDB Support">BrightstarDB Support</a> page.
