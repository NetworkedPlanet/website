<p>The TMCore SharePoint Module is an integration between Microsoft SharePoint 2007 and the TMCore Information Server that allows SharePoint users to quickly and easily organise content in a SharePoint site using a topic map ontology defined and managed separately by a librarian or systems administrator.</p>

<p>Features of this first beta of the integration include:

<ul>

<li>Classify any content against the topic map - any SharePoint site, list or list item can be classified.</li>

<li>Ontology-driven classification - the classification UI uses the topic map ontology to make it easy for users to connect items to other topics and to provide only occurrence data that is relevant to the item.</li>

<li>Map SharePoint Content Types to the ontology - this makes the classification of SharePoint items almost completely automated. The administrator sets up a content type to topic type mapping that defines how content items should be classified.</li>

<li>Browse and edit associations as SharePoint meta-data - a custom field type allows administrators to add fields to SharePoint lists that reflect association infomation from the topic map. Users see these fields as hyperlinks taking them to the related item and can edit them on the normal SharePoint meta-data editing screens.</li>

<li>Suite of WebParts - a selection of web parts allow users to search or browse the topic map as well as to display or edit the details of topics.</li>

</ul>
