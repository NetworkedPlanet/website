Our EPiServer search engine has made it onto <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FfYYluIgMg">YouTube </a>thanks to a great blog <a href="http://labs.episerver.com/en/Blogs/Stein-Viggo-Grenersen/Dates/2009/5/Search-made-easy/">post </a>by Stein-Viggo Grenersen of BVNetwork on EPiLabs. The video shows how to use EasySearch with episerver categories (or topic maps classification) to provide high performance faceted filtering of full text search results.
