My first thought when contacted regarding taking part at Open:2017 was simply: "What's a platform co-operative?" and once I read up on that, I quickly made space in my calendar for it. [This blogpost introducing the concept of platform cooperatives](https://open.coop/2016/12/02/introduction-platform-co-ops/) is a great starting point: 

> Just like traditional co-ops, platform co-ops are organisations that are owned and managed by their members. While traditional co-ops are normally based around a physical community of members, platform co-ops live online and are normally populated by online communities of members.

A subject very close to my heart is the ongoing question of how we enable people (through the use of technology) to retain control of the data we collect in order to get information out to people who need it. 


> By providing a viable alternative to the standard internet business model based on monopoly and extraction, platform cooperatives provide a template for a new type of organisation â€“ forming the building blocks for a new economy.
