Today we are proud to have launched Subj3ct.

Subj3ct is a Subject Identity Resolution Service, it provides both a portal for humans to use and an API for developers and applications. We store subject identifiers, equivalent identifiers and also links to web resources that contain structured or unstructured information about a subject.

The resolution service is intended to provide services to:

a) people looking to re-use common identifiers in order to improve interchange

b) application developers who are building the next generation of web applications, where dynamically finding and merging linked data is key

We are starting out in gathering mode, trying to get collections of identifiers registered so that we have a useful set of subjects.

Once we have this we will be creating new features and writing more on how to use the service in building Web 3.0 applications.

In the meantime, we would really appreciate it if people can register subject feeds and just generally provide feedback on the portal and API.

Everything can be found at <del datetime="2013-04-03T12:34:53+00:00">https://subj3ct.com</del>

Finally, thanks for all the support and encouragement we have received in putting this exciting service together.

<strong>EDIT</strong>: Sadly due to constraints of time and money for funding a free service we have had to withdraw Subj3ct from general use.
