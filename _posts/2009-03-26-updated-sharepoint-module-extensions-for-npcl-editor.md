Today we have released a compatibility upgrade for the SharePoint Module extensions for the NPCL Schema Editor.

Due to some binary incompatibilities bewteen the Visual Studio SDKs for VS 2005 and VS 2008, the SharePoint Module Extensions for the NPCL Schema Editor that are provided with the current release of the SharePoint Module (SharePoint Module 3.1 Hotfix 1) do not load correctly when using Visual Studion 2008 and version 3.0 of the NPCL Schema Editor.

The new release is intended for use ONLY with version 3.0 of the NPCL Schema Editor in Visual Studio 2008 - for details and download please see <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/npcl-schema-editor-for-visual-studio-2008/" title="NPCL Schema Editor for Visual Studio 2008">this earlier posting</a>.

The updated SharePoint Module Extensions can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/SPModule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.0.NpclEditorExtensions.zip">here</a>. To install, simply copy the contents of the zip file into the Extensions directory as described in the documentation for the NPCL Schema Editor.
