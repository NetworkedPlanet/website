While we are great fans of Open Data, it is just one part of a spectrum from data that
needs to be kept secure (such as personal information) through data that is shared between
partner organisations all the way to data that is made available to all to use and reuse.

This nice, short video from the ODI explains the concepts of Closed, Shared and Open data.
