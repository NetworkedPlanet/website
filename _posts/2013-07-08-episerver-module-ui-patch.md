We have just released a minor patch to the TMCore EPiServer Module 7.0. This fixes a UI issue with the new EPiServer edit interface where a Javascript error could occur when more than one Topic Map widget is added to the interface. The patch can be installed by downloading the <a href="/download/EPiServerModule/NetworkedPlanet.EPiServerModule.AddOn.7.0.0.1.nupkg" title="Download the NetworkedPlanet EPiServer Module AddOn Package.">NetworkedPlanet.EPiServerModule.AddOn.7.0.0.1.nupkg NuGet package</a> and installing it manually through the AddOns page of your EPiServer installation.
