Actually there should be no outage, we hope...but its always best to plan for the worst :-)

This weekend (12th-15th December) we will be migrating our mail servers which means there may be a short period of outage. This will mainly affect the web form for requesting product evaluation licenses (which will be disabled for the period of the move) and may also result in messages to support@networkedplanet.com not receiving the normal automated reply.

The plan is that all email should still be delivered to us, but if you send us an email over this weekend and don't get a reply by Monday please try sending it again.
