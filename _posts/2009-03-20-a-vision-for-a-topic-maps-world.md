Yesterday at the Topic Maps 2009 conference in Oslo I gave a presentation called 'A Vision for a Topic Maps World'. In this presentation I summarised some of the key successes of Topic Maps and then looked forward to how Topic Maps can work on a more global scale.

One of the key things I presented was a concept for a Subject Identity Resolution service, a kind of DNS for subjects and representations of statements about subjects.

The full presentation can be found <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/vision_for_a_topic_maps_world.pdf">here</a>.

We'll be blogging more about the Subject Identity Resolution Service over the coming weeks.
