NetworkedPlanet today released a patch for TMCore07 SP1. This patch affects only the database scripts for TMCore07 and TMCore07 SP1, updating those scripts to fix an error found in the implementation of a few stored procedures.

This procedures that are patched are used primarily by the NPCL subsystem and EPiServer Module. The patch is RECOMMENDED for all users of TMCore07 and REQUIRED for installation of the TMCore EPiServer Module.

The patch performs non-destructive upgrade of the database - no data is affected, only stored procedure implementations are replaced.

The TMCore07 SP1 Hotfix can be downloaded <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/tmcore/tmcore07sp1-hotfix1.zip">here</a>.
