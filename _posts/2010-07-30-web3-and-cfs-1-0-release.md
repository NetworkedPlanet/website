We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of the 1.0 release of our Web3 Platform and Concepts for SharePoint products.



The Web3 Platform is our "next-generation" structured information server built on the foundation of topic maps but with support for Linked Data standards including RDF and the SPARQL query language. The Web3 Platform provides a fully-featured REST API making it possible to create applications in almost any programming language and to quickly and easily integrate structured information into existing applications and websites. The Web3 service provides full support for the topic maps data model and support for browsing content as Linked Data RDF as well as providing a SPARQL endpoint that implements support for querying topic map data as RDF as well as querying at the detailed topic map data model level.



Concepts for SharePoint is simply the best way to organise, search for and find content on a SharePoint 2010 server. It integrates with and extends the taxonomy features of SharePoint 2010, allowing users to create richly interconnected data models that reflect the business in which they work. Unlike the tags in a standard SharePoint 2010 taxonomy, the concepts in Concepts for SharePoint can be made available as published pages complete with links to other concepts and to related content across the whole SharePoint server.



Both products are <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/" title="Request Evaluation">available for evaluation</a>.
