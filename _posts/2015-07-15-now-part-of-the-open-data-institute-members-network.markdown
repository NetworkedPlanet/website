It goes without saying that we are huge supporters of the Open Data Institute (ODI), but from today we are now *official* supporters of the ODI as part of their members network.

Founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee (who created a little something known as the *World Wide Web*) along with Sir Nigel Shadbolt - the ODI's mission is to "[catalyse the evolution of an open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value][odi-faq]".

We're looking forward to hearing more about the development of best practice methods in the field of Open Data - exciting times!
