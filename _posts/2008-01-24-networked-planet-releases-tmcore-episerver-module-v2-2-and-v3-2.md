<h3>TMCore EPiServer Module v2.2 and v3.2 Released</h3>

<p>NetworkedPlanet launches the latest version of the EPiServer Topic Map module, now supporting <a href="http://www.episerver.com/">EPiServer CMS 5</a>. The TMCore EPiServer Module provides seamless integration with one of the premier web content management solutions on the Microsoft .NET platform.</p>

<p>The TMCore EPiServer Module delivers a simple, powerful model for EPiServer editors and administrators to exploit the flexibility of topic maps within their web site, providing concept based navigation and search as well as improved link management.</p>

<p>NetworkedPlanet has been working closely with our business partners in order to deliver exciting new features and an improved user experience in this latest release.</p>

<p>The EPiServer Module highlights:

<ul><li>All new AJAX based topic association editing environment.</li>

<li>Full exploitation of the new features of TMCore07.</li>

<li>Configuration and data consistency checking and automatic repair utilities, integrated in with EPiServer's administrator tools.</li>

<li>Powerful topic map navigation data controls that provide a simple mechanism for querying the topic map and rendering the results using the standard template-based data-bound ASP.NET controls.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>The Topic Map advantage enables organisations to organise and find their information in a non-hierarchical, multi-dimensional way. The TMCore engine can be used as an integration platform with content from multiple system aggregated and delivered through the power of the EPiServer platform.</p>
