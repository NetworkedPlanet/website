We are putting together a series of short videos that show how to do different things with the Web3 Platform and Concepts for SharePoint. The first of these videos,Â <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKkbV6lXqNE">Web3 Platform Getting Started No 1.</a> is now available.



The Web3 Platform is a complete data driven environment. This means that with no code you can create a data model and immediately begin to add data either through the generated UI or via the RESTful interface. The first video shows how to create a simple schema using the Silverlight editor and then create topics and associations through the schema driven editor.
