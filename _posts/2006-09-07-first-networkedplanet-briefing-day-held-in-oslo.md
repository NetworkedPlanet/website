The first NetworkedPlanet Briefing Day was held in Oslo this week. The briefing day attracted over 30 partners and customers of NetworkedPlanet. The directors of NetworkedPlanet, Graham Moore and Kal Ahmed, gave a series of presentations and demos to explain the company vision and to show upcoming products and technology including the features of the next version of the TMCore topic map engine, TMCore07.

The day was also used to get feedback from partners and customers on what forms of communication would be most useful. The most popular request was for a blog and subscribable feed of news from the NetworkedPlanet website. You asked for it, and here it is!

We would like to thank all the people that attended this event and especially to thank our partners <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/partners/">Bouvet</a> for allowing us to make use of their office facilities for this event.
