NetworkedPlanet are pleased to announce the release of version 3.3 of the TMCore SharePoint Module.



The TMCore SharePoint Module 3.3 is a tight integration between Microsoft SharePoint 2013 and the TMCore information management server that greatly improves the way information is organised, classified and located with Microsoft SharePoint solutions.

This new release includes all the features and enhancements of the SharePoint Module 3.2 hotfix 5, and is packaged to be installed on SharePoint 2013.



The new version is available for all customers with a current maintenance contract. Due to the complex upgrade process needed to upgrade SharePoint 2007/2010 to SharePoint 2013, we advise all current customers to <a href="mailto:contact@networkedplanet.com">contact us</a> with details of your current solutions so that we can advise you of the best steps to take to ensure a smooth upgrade of the SharePoint Module alongside your SharePoint upgrade.
