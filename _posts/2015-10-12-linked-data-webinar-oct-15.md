We are pleased to announce our second training webinar, "Introduction to Linked Data". This is a (mostly)
non-technical presentation focussed on the what and why of Linked Data - what is Linked Data, what are 
the benefits of publishing and using Linked Data, what are the steps to take in publishing your own
Linked Data either internally or externally.

The webinar will be presented by Kal Ahmed who in addition to being the founder of NetworkedPlanet is also
the lead developer of [BrightstarDB](http://brightstardb.com/).

This webinar is FREE, but places are limited.
