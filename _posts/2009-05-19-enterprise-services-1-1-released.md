We have just made a new version of Enterprise Services available for download. This release fixes a bug with the indexing of hierarchies where one topic has multiple parents in the same hierarchy. There are no compatibility issues with version 1.0 of Enterprise Services and so this is a recommended upgrade for all users of Enterprise Services 1.0.

Please check the instructions contained in UPGRADE.TXT for important information on the upgrade process.
