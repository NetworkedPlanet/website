<h3>TMCore EPiServer Module v2.0 Released</h3>

<p>NetworkedPlanet launches the latest version of the EPiServer Topic Map module. The TMCore EPiServer Module provides seamless integration with one of the premier web content management solutions on the Microsoft .NET platform.</p>

<p>The TMCore EPiServer Module delivers a simple, powerful model for EPiServer editors and administrators to exploit the flexibility of topic maps within their web site, providing concept based navigation and search as well as improved link management.</p>

<p>NetworkedPlanet has been working closely with our business partners in order to deliver exciting new features and an improved user experience in this latest release.</p>

<p>The EPiServer Module highlights:

<ul><li>All new AJAX based topic association editing environment.</li>

<li>Full exploitation of the new features of TMCore07.</li>

<li>Configuration and data consistency checking and automatic repair utilities, integrated in with EPiServer's administrator tools.</li>

<li>Powerful topic map navigation data controls that provide a simple mechanism for querying the topic map and rendering the results using the standard template-based data-bound ASP.NET controls.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>The Topic Map advantage enables organisations to organise and find their information in a non-hierarchical, multi-dimensional way. The TMCore engine can be used as an integration platform with content from multiple system aggregated and delivered through the power of the EPiServer platform.</p>

<p>The TMCore EPiServer Module is compatible with ASP.NET 1.1 & 2.0 and EPiServer 4.60 and later.</p>
