NetworkedPlanet is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the TMCore05 EPiServer Module. This module, built on the TMCore05 topic maps toolkit, adds intuitive, schema-driven content classification and search components to the ElektroPost EPiServer web content-management system.

Topic maps provide a solid foundation for building a content-rich website that is both easy to navigate and easy to manage and extend. Under a topic-map driven portal model, the topic map is used to create some or all of the site navigation - from structuring the main navigation menus to providing contextual "Related content" links. By classifying new content against the subjects that it relates too, content creators can populate a site without having to manually add links into the site navigation or to related content.

The TMCore05 EPiServer Module consists of:

<ul>

<li>A set of editorial tools that integrate into the editorial view of an EPiServer site and provide an intuitive interface that allows content creators to classify the content they write against a topic map.</li>

<li>An integrated topic publication system that allows changes to the classification of content and to the site ontology to be published to the live site either independently or as part of the normal content approval and publication life-cycle.</li>

<li>A set of ASP.NET components which can be used to add topic map-driven navigation to EPiServer templates, providing robust subject-oriented content navigation features without any manual link management.</li>

</ul>

The TMCore05 EPiServer Module is available now. For more product details please see the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/products/episerver-module.html">product features page</a>.
