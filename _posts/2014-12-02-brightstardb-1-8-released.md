The BrightstarDB project has just reached another milestone with the 1.8 release <a href="http://brightstardb.com/2014/12/02/brightstardb-1-8-released.html">announced today</a>. This version adds some requested features to the Entity Framework and Data Objects APIs as well as some performance enhancements. In addition, from this release a Docker image is now available - this is really exciting news as it enables admins to swiftly deploy BrightstarDB instances into dockerized environments - in particular it makes it now trivial to get BrightstarDB up and running in a VM on Azure or AWS.



As with previous versions of BrightstarDB, NetworkedPlanet offers <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/support/brightstardb-support/">commercial support contracts</a> as well as consultancy and development assistance for projects using (or considering using) BrightstarDB.
