This workshop will help you learn about the upcoming changes to Data Protection law ([General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) in relation to evaluation data, for both existing data and future data collection. During the interactive sessions, you will master new terms and concepts covering GDPR, Linked and Open Data, and the role a Theory of Change can play in data strategy design. 

This exciting afternoon promises to help you: 

* Navigate data collection and evaluation under the GDPR with practical advice and guidance
* Meet (and begin collaborating with) other professionals dealing with data in their day-to-day work
* Get to know leaders in data innovation 

Led by [The Social Innovation Partnership (TSIP)](https://tsip.co.uk/), [NetworkedPlanet](http://networkedplanet.com/), and [Digital Catapult Centre](https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/), the interactive workshop will be presented in four parts: 

* [Adrienne Monteath-van Dok](https://tsip.co.uk/ajax/people/2455) from [TSIP](https://tsip.co.uk/) will introduce the role that a Theory of Change can play in data design. Adrienne will use Camp Ballot, a mock organisation that collects data in real time via SMS to improve the quality of services offered to refugees in refugee camps, to help you work through the data challenges you face with a safe and practical example.
* [Jen Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrpwilliams/), Software Developer and Data Consultant from [NetworkedPlanet](http://networkedplanet.com/), will further build on this example, explaining the world of Open and Linked Data and guiding a discussion of how thinking across the web-of-data could support Camp Ballot’s mission. 
* [Lea Gorgulu Webb](https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/find-a-fellow/profile/128435) from [NetworkedPlanet](http://networkedplanet.com/) (a lawyer and data strategist) will then provide an overview of the GDPR in the UK (given the current status of Brexit), again, using Camp Ballot to gain experience working with the data protection laws of the EU and UK.
* Once you’ve mastered the main elements of the GDPR, [Lucie Burgess](https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/about/our-team/), from [Digital Catapult Centre](https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/) will discuss innovative concepts and approaches to help you comply with data protection and privacy.

The session will end with details of where to turn for further help, followed by networking drinks.
