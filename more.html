                <h2>Building data strategies</h2>
                <p>A data strategy takes into account the whole life-cycle of the data in your organisation. It starts
                    with your goals and determining what data you need to use to meet those goals.
                    It goes both upstream to analyze and improve data collection; and downstream to
                    formalise the insights and knowledge captured from data and to determine the impact of
                    changes in the way you capture and use data.</p>

                <p>A living data strategy is a feedback loop that is continually adjusted to account for new data,
                    new uses for data and new actions and insights derived from combining your data with other data sources.
                </p>

                <p>We can help you develop a holistic data strategy, and provide ongoing support at whatever level you need.</p>

                <h2>Taking control of your data</h2>
                <p>As the volume of data inside an organisation grows it quickly becomes critical to get control
                    over it. An effective data strategy is a good place to start, but it is also necessary to get
                    processes in place and the technical details right.</p>

                <p>We can use our experience to help you create the right processes for managing and sharing your
                    data both internally and externally. We can help you deploy the best tools for cataloguing your
                    data, for data analysis and for publishing and reporting to enable all stakeholders to get maximum
                    value from your data.</p>
