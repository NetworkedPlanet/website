                <h2>Building data strategies</h2>
                <p>A data strategy takes into account the whole life-cycle of the data in your organisation.
                    It starts with your goals and determining what data you need to use to meet those goals.
                    It goes both upstream to analyze and improve data collection; and downstream to
                    formalise the insights and knowledge captured from data and to determine the
                    impact of changes in the way you capture and use data.</p>

            <p>Every strategy must include safeguards and comply with data protection and copyright laws. By
                tackling these issues as part of your data strategy, you can then identify what data could
                potentially be made open, and what data must remain closed.
            </p>

                <p>A living data strategy is a feedback loop that is continually adjusted to account for new data,
                    new uses for data and new actions and insights derived from combining your data with other data sources.
                </p>

                <p>We can help you develop a holistic data strategy, and provide ongoing support at whatever level you need.</p>

                <h2>Taking control of your data</h2>
                <p>As the volume of data inside an organisation grows it quickly becomes critical to get
                    control over it. An effective data strategy is a good place to start, but it is also
                    necessary to get processes in place and the technical details right.
                </p>

                <p>We can use our experience to help you create the right processes for managing and sharing your
                    data both internally and externally. We can help you deploy the best tools for cataloguing
                    your data, for data analysis and for publishing and reporting to enable all stakeholders to get
                    maximum value from your data.

                <h2>Use Open Data With Confidence</h2>
                <p>Open data is data published by organizations, governments and individuals with a license that
                    enables free reuse. A wide variety of open data is already available, from international
                    development statistics to local bus timetables.</p>

                <p>Open data potentially provides valuable context and extensions to your data, but to get the best
                    value from it you need to understand how to choose the right open data and how to integrate it
                    effectively with your own data. This involves technical, legal and procedural challenges that we can
                    guide you through.</p>

                <h2>Strengthening Your Data Team</h2>
                <p>Data teams come in various shapes, sizes, and forms. Whether a department of professionals for
                    gathering data and analysing it for insights, or small teams of service providers learning
                    how to collect data and present basic findings, we can advise and support your team.</p>

                <p>We offer full consultancy, technical services, and training.  For larger teams, we can introduce
                    new technology that will allow the better use and management of data and integration with open data.</p>

                <p>For smaller teams, we offer training in accessing and using open and linked data, and support for
                    funding agencies, which allows linkage of data between many organisations.
