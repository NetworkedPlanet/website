		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many projects are developing solutions on XP and then deploying them onto Windows 2003 Server. To minimise the configuration issues here are a few suggestions:
On Windows 2003:
Install the TMCore Services (TMEditor, TMService and NPCLService) into their own website (perhaps called TMCore) with its own AppPool. Just copying the DefaultAppPool works fine. This has the benefit of keeping TMCore out of the EPiServer project space (i.e. no fiddling with httpmodule exclusions etc, issues with different .NET versions).
Install the EPiServer Project into its own website and configure as normal. The only property in the EPiServerModule that needs to be changed is the one referencing the TMWS endpoint. Obviously the TMCore website will be running on a different port to the EPiServer site.
On Windows XP:
The real pain here is that IIS can only host one website! And even worse is that while Microsoft have achieved binary compatibility between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 they have failed to ensure XML compatibility in the web.config files! Thus if you are using the ASP.NET 1.1 TMCore services it is not possible to deploy them under an EPiServer install using ASP.NET 2.0.
Some options:
1. Use the TMCore ASP.NET 2.0 Web Services for TMEditor, TMWS and NPCL, and install them under the EPiServer virtual website.
2. Install a virtual machine (either MS or VMWare) and on this install TMCore. The benefit of this is that this machine can then run happily and support multiple projects.
3. Not sure EPiServer recommend this any more, but install EPiServer in a virtual directory and TMCore services in virtual directories all in the same website. The advantage of this is that it removes the need for fiddling with the httpmodule exclusions AND means that TMCore can support multiple projects more cleanly.
Hope this helps.

		<title>EPiServerModule 2.0 Changes - GUID vs. Page ID</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/episervermodule-2-0-changes-guid-vs-page-id/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In the latest version of the Networked Planet TMCore EPiServer Module (henceforth TEM); we moved away from the model of using EPiServer page IDs to instead use a dynamically generated GUID.</strong></p>
<h3>EPiServer Module 1.x</h3>
<p>In TEM 1.x each topic that represented in a page in EPiServer would have a subject identifier which was composed of a prefix (typically <em>http://www.networkedplanet.com/2005/01/episerver/np-gen-psi/</em> followed by the integer ID of the page that this topic represented.  The advantages of this system were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ID was persistent in EPiServer, so there were no concerns with the ID changing <em>within</em> an EPiServer installation.</li>
<li>The subject identifier of the topic could be easily derived from the page (just add the prefix), and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately this system also carried a penalty.  If page data was exported from EPiServer and then migrated to a new EPiServer installation, a new ID would be assigned, usually different from the old id.  This means that the link between the page and the topic was broken.  In short, moving page data around between servers was very difficult and we felt we had to address this in the 2.0 release of the TEM.</p>
<h3>EPiServer Module 2.0</h3>
<p>In TEM 2.0 we require the definition a new dynamic property to EPiServer which is a GUID, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier"><em>G</em>lobally <em>U</em>nique <em>ID</em>entifier</a>.  The GUID is then used, in combination with a prefix <code>urn:guid:</code>, to construct the subject identifier of the topic representing the page.</p>
<p>The result of this is that the GUID property of the page is unchanged throughout the life of the page, and is preserved through export operations.  This therefore allows EPiServer administrators to export page data, export the XTM from TMCore and then import in to new systems and the system will work as expected.</p>
<p>The EPiServer page ID can still be derived from the a topic via an occurrence value on the topic, typed by the <em>Page ID occurrence type</em> topic, by default this a topic with the subject identifier <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/2005/01/episerver/pageid</code>.
<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Of course, nothing ever comes for free, there are few ill-considered things you can do to EPiServer which will cause problems with this new system.</p>
<p>The most serious of these is to delete the dynamic property from EPiServer.  This causes all GUID values of pages to be destroyed.  These values are unfortunately unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Manually setting the GUID is also unwise, not only do you risk setting the GUID to a value which will potentially clash with another page ID, but also you will put the page GUID out of sync with the topic GUID.  This means that you must either:
<ol>
<li>Manually set the GUID subject identifier on the topic to match the changed page GUID; or</li>
<li>Run the TEM consistency checker which will create a new topic for the page, based on the new GUID.  However, this will leave the old topic hanging around in the system, along with all its associations which may cause confusion.</li>
</ol>
</p>

		<title>Introducing TMCore07</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>
Since our first release of the TMCore engine in 2005, we have worked through 3 separate "minor" upgrades, each of which not only improved performance and fixed the occasional bug, but each of them also added some new features to extend the range of the API or provide a more useful "out-of-the-box" experience with the product. This month we proudly unwrap TMCore07, our first "major" upgrade to the TMCore engine. This month we also kick off "On Topic" our product and techie news blog. So this seems like the best time to review TMCore07, explain what we have done that warranted a new major version and how we hope it will address some of the feedback we have received from customers and from using the product ourselves on numerous projects.
<strong>What's Not New</strong>
We have worked in software development for many years and we know that perhaps one of the most important things to know when you decide whether or not to upgrade a deployed solution is not so much what is new and improved in the product, but what is unchanged and can be relied upon to work from one release to the next. So before we get into what is shiny and new, lets first look at what hasn't changed and at what has changed that might give you some pause for concern (and how we have tried to address that concern in advance!). If you are a newcomer to TMCore (welcome!), you can probably skip this whole section and not miss much if you go directly to <a href="#newstuff">what's new in TMCore07</a>
The three principle access points to TMCore are the API, the Web Services interface and the TMRQL public views and store procedures that allow you to write your own queries against the TMCore database. All thre have had some interesting additions, but in all cases we have worked to keep the changes compatible with older code.
If you have written code (C#. VB etc) against the TMCore05 API, you should find that all your existing TMCore05 code will run against the TMCore07 database with no changes. The TMCore installation includes a policy file that gets installed in the GAC and redirects any references to previous versions of tmcore.dll to the new version in the GAC, so in most cases you shouldn't even need to recompile.
If you have code that uses the TMCore Web Service by binding directly to the WSDL files that came with TMCore05, your code should require no changes - we kept all of the operations in TMCore05 in the transition to TMCore07, however we have added some new features and if you use the Web Servie to perform updates on a topic map I would definitely recommend that you look at the new ProcessTransaction method. We have also made a significant change to the way that queries invoked through the Query method on the Web Service are configured and processed - again we strongly recommend that you look into this and update your Web.config file for the Web Service if you have some customised queries defined in it. If you wrote web service client code using the serviceclient.dll assembly however you will need to recompile and possibly to modify your code a little - we took the opportunity of TMCore07 to tidy up the class structure in serviceclient.dll a little and to add some new features and convenience methods (which you may want to look into if you are updating your code anyway).
The TMCore TMRQL views and stored procedures in TMCore05 are also unchanged in TMCore07 so queries that worked against TMCore05 databases should return the same results when run against TMCore07. Although the script has expanded quite a lot, many of the additions are private stored procedures that are currently used by the web service ProcessTransaction operation. We can't stress enough that you should NEVER rely on these stored procedures being stable from one release of TMCore to the next and that therefore you should NEVER make use of them in your own code or queries. If the stored procedure or view name starts with the prefix "tm_" (or "TM_"), it is a public part of the TMRQL spec and will remain constant at least for this major version of TMCore. Anything in the database that starts with "_tm" or "_TM" or indeed with any other characters, should be treated as private and prone to change or removal in any forthcoming minor release.
OK, thats enough for you upgraders. Lets join the newbies and see what is worth getting excited about in TMCore07.

<strong>What's New In TMCore07</strong>

<li><a href="#ws">Web Service Enhancements</a> - including transactional updates and AJAX-friendly interfaces.</li>
<li><a href="#npcl">Networked  Planet Constraint Language</a> - a model and XML syntax for expressing a topic map ontology.</li>

<hr/>
<a name="ws"><strong>Web Service Enhancements</strong></a>
The TMCore Web Service has been one of the most stable, reliable bits of the product The service interface was unchanged since the first release of TMCore05...until now (and even now we have only added a single new operation!). The one issue with the Web Service that we found from our own use and project work was that doing an update to the topic map was unecessarily complex. This all comes from the fact that the Save method has the simple semantic that the caller provides the complete definition of how the topic or association should be recorded in the topic map. That means that if you have a topic with 200 occurrences and all you want to do is delete one, you still need to provide the complete <topic> structure with 199 <occurrence> elements in it! Although easy to understand, the difficulty with this approach is that in order to modify a topic you must first know what the current topic structure is - and in a number of cases you actually want to push a change into a topic without knowing its current state (and, of course there are also concurrency issues in which one client could unwittingly overwrite the changes made by another). So to address these issues we proudly introduce the ProcessTransaction operation...tada!
As its name suggests, ProcessTransaction allows the caller to request that a list of operations on the topic map be carried out as a single transaction. The operations supported are listed below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Operation Name</th><th>What it does</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>CreateTopic</td><td>Takes a complete definition of a new topic and adds it to the topic map (merging with existing topics if necessary).</tr>
<tr><td>UpdateTopic</td><td>Takes a complete definition of the structure of an existing topic in the topic map and modifies the topic so that it matches the new structure. This is equivalent to the Save operation with the additional benefit that multiple topics can be updated in a single transaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DeleteTopic</td><td>Removes an identified topic from the topic map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CreateTopicProperty</td><td>Adds one or more names, identifiers, types or occurrences to an identified topic. This operation allows you to write new information into a topic without having to know the full structure of the topic in advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DeleteTopicProperty</td><td>Removes one or more names, identifiers, types or occurrences from an identified topic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CreateAssociation</td><td>Takes a complete definition of a new association and adds it to the topic map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DeleteAssociation</td></td>Removes an identified association from the topic map.</td></tr>
</table>
We will look at the use of ProcessTransaction in more detail in a future article, but for now it is worth pointing out a couple of things. Firstly, remember that you can use as many of these operations together in a single transaction as you want. A ProcessTransaction call is executed in a single database transaction, with an automatic rollback if one operation in the transaction fails. In implementation these operations typically map to one or two lookups followed by execution of a stored procedure against the database, so there is a practical limit to the size of transaction you should send, but in theory you can throw as big a transaction as your database server will handle at the service. Secondly you will notice that there is no UpdateTopicProperty method - combining DeleteTopicProperty and CreateTopicProperty in a transaction has the nice effect of effectively performing an update and without the overhead of a complex syntax for identifying which property is to be updated and how. Thirdly for operations that act on an "identified" topic, the identified can be either the datatbase object ID of the topic, or an identifier (subject identifier, subject locator or source locator) for the topic, or an transaction-specific string identifier assigned to a topic in the CreateTopic operation (this allows you to create two topics and then reference them in a CreateAssociation operation all in a single transaction). Finally, the DeleteTopicProperty and DeleteAssociation methods support matching the item to be deleted "by value" - that is by allowing you to specify the structure of the property or association to be deleted. Matching by value supports some simple wild-carding operations so it is possible for example to issue a command to delete all "Home Phone Number" type occurrences from a topic and then create a new "Home Phone Number" occurrence to replace them.
<emph>XML Over HTTP Interfaces</emph>
To be honest we originally wanted these to be REST interfaces, but the RESTful service interface we came up with just got too horribly complicated. Instead we have opted for a simple mapping of all of the existing web service operations (including ProcessTransaction) to simple ASP.NET web forms that allow you to POST an XML document containing the request parameters or, for most operations at least, to issue a GET with the request parameters encoded as URL parameters. What these interfaces do is support AJAX applications, Flash applications and a huge raft of other scripting languages that have their own built-in XML processing and HTTP comms libraries (and that pretty much includes all modern scripting languages...even csh ;-)
<hr/>
<a name="npcl"><strong>NetworkedPlanet Constriant Language</strong></a>
When we added the Topic Map Editor to TMCore05 we realised that there was a need for a simple but expressive ontology language for topic maps - something that allows ontology designers to specify their ontology as topic types, occurrence types, association types and so on. TMEditor in TMCore05 provided a very simplistic model of meta-types which has now been superceded by the NetworkedPlanet Constraint Langauge (NPCL). NPCL is a big topic that we will be returning too in this blog a number of times I suspect. However its key features are:
<ol>
<li>You can specify that a topic can be used as a topic type, occurrence type, association type or association role type (or any combination of these four).</li>
<li>You can define constraints between types of three different kinds:
<ul><li>Topic Occurrence Constriants: Specify that a topic of type T can (or should) have some number of occurrences of type O.</li>
<li>Role Player Constraints: Specify that a topic of type T can (or should) play a role of type R (optionally limiting it to being roles of type R in associations of type A)</li>
<li>Association Role Constraints: Specify that an assocation of type A can (or should) have some number of association roles of type R.</li>
</ul>
These constraints can all have cardinality counts (minimum/maximum) associated with them. This allows you to express things such as "A 'Person' topic must have a single 'Age' occurrence"; "A 'Person' topic can play an 'Employee' role in a 'Works For' association zero or more times"; and "A 'Works For' association must have exactly one 'Employee' role and exactly one 'Employer' role.
</li>
<li>In addition to cardinality counts, both types and constraints can have additional meta-data, this meta-data model is extensible, allowing you to add your own application-specific annotations to your ontology.</li>
<li>The NPCL type and constraint information can be represented in topic map form, meaning that you can store your schema in the topic map that has the data and edit it with normal topic map editing tools. However, the information can also be represented in a simple XML form (schema provided!) which makes it alot easier to write. We have provided command-line tools for converting between these forms and for importing the XML version of NPCL into a topic map and for getting the NPCL information in a topic map out in the XML format.</li>
</ol>
The current implementation of NPCL focusses solely on allowing you as a developer to store NPCL information and to get at it again - we do not enforce your ontology at the API level (the merits of this are debatable) and we do not currently provide any validation tools. Right now our feeling is that validation tools would be useful, schema enforcement at the TMCore API level would end up being prohibitive. However the lack of validation tools does not mean that NPCL as it currently stands is useless - instead it provides a simple, consistent platform on which you can build applications that do enforce the rules such as forms-based editing or data-entry interfaces.
Finally on the subject of NPCL for now it is worth mentioning that TMCore07 also includes a small web service for retrieving the NPCL information for a topic map or for a single type in the topic map. There is currently no web serivce interface for updating the NPCL information in a topic map. I should probably also mention that NPCL has been presented to the ISO committe working on the forthcoming ISO Topic Maps Constraint Language specification and the current indications are the TMCL will use a very similar model, so when ISO publish the standard it should be possible to simply convert NPCL information into TMCL.
<hr/>
<a name="tmeditor"><strong>TMEditor 2.0</strong></a>
When it was first released, we received quite a few comments about our generic topic map editing application. Not all of them positive - the main complaint was that the interface was too clunky - a lot of clicks needed to do simple tasks and the interface seemed a little too much tailored to a power user. The other main complaint was with the lack of options for locating topics to edit or to use as types or scopes. The other complaint we had (this is true) was that it was too green.
So we decided that TMCore07 should have a completely new TMEditor application.
The main part of the new interface is a tabbed topic editor. Each tab allows you to edit a different aspect of the topic, names on one tab, occurrences on the next and so on - this gives much more screen space and means that each separate editing tab can be laid out to be a more useable. There is also a Summary tab which allows you to navigate the topic map within the editor application.
Another key feature to the new user interface is the History List. This little widget sits in the top-right corner of the editor and tracks the topics you visit. You can also add topics into this list by searching for them and clicking on them in the results list. What the History List lets you do is keep a set of topics in easy reach which can be invaluable when creating occurrences and associations of the same type repeatedly (for example an association with two roles requires 4 topics other than the one you are editing to be specified completely plus any additional topics required for scoping purposes).
The final major feature is the utilities tab set on the right. This provides a simple way to create new topics (making it far easier to enter a list of new topics); and several topic map search and browse options. On of the neatest is the Topic Chooser. The Topic Chooser is launched from the main editing interface by clicking on a button labelled "..". The chooser tab then displays a context-sensitive list of the topics that would be appropriate for the field from which it was launched. The Topic Chooser is driven by the NPCL ontology for the topic map, so if you launch the Chooser from the Association Type field on the Associations editor tab, it would display only a list of association types defined in the NPCL ontology. If you set the role type field for an association and then launch the chooser on the role player field you see only a list of topics that can play that type of role.
The entry page to TMEditor has also been overhauled. You can now manage the topic maps in TMCore through this interface - creating new topic maps, removing unwanted ones and managing the NPCL schema for a topic map as well as importing and exporting XTM files.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
This has been a quick tour around the major new features of TMCore. We will have more to say on some of these features in later articles. As always, we provide a free 90-day evaluation license which you can request <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/">here</a>.

There have been additions to the documentation and the AJAX topic editing client.  However, deploying over the top of an existing installation will work correctly; the obsolete files will simply not be used.
<h4>Is it necessary to run the EpiServerModule.sql when I am updating?</h4>
Yes, we've updated the SQL Stored Procedures. However, this does not change any of the data in the database.
<h4>Which <code>web.config</code> settings should be added/removed?</h4>
No settings <strong>must</strong> be removed or changed, however you should review your existing <code>web.config</code> configuration with the installation guide to ensure correct operation.
<h4>Adding a new Dynamic Property 'topicidentity' to the EPiServer Project. Should there be a default value?</h4>
No value is required as default. It will get filled in automatically on each page by the EPiServer Module, either during the page create post-processing, or by the consistency checker.
<h4>The first time I run the Consistency Checker I get a lot problems reported</h4>
<pre><em>page name</em> has no GUID. Will create one: urn:guid:<em>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</em>
<em>page name</em> has unwanted subject identifier <em>http://www.networkedplanet.com/2005/01/episerver/np-gen-psi/<em>pageid</em></em>
<em>page name</em> requires new subject identifier: urn:guid:<em>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</em></pre>
In TEM 2.0 we require the definition a new dynamic property to EPiServer which is a GUID, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier"><em>G</em>lobally <em>U</em>nique <em>ID</em>entifier</a>.  The GUID is then used, in combination with a prefix <code>urn:guid:</code>, to construct the subject identifier of the topic representing the page.

The result of this is that the GUID property of the page is unchanged throughout the life of the page, and is preserved through export operations.  This therefore allows EPiServer administrators to export page data, export the XTM from TMCore and then import in to new systems and the system will work as expected.

The EPiServer page ID can still be derived from the a topic via an occurrence value on the topic, typed by the <em>Page ID occurrence type</em> topic, by default this a topic with the subject identifier <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/2005/01/episerver/pageid</code>.

The old subject identifier is no longer required and will be removed by the consistency checker.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NetworkedPlanet is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the TMCore05 EPiServer Module. This module, built on the TMCore05 topic maps toolkit, adds intuitive, schema-driven content classification and search components to the ElektroPost EPiServer web content-management system.
Topic maps provide a solid foundation for building a content-rich website that is both easy to navigate and easy to manage and extend. Under a topic-map driven portal model, the topic map is used to create some or all of the site navigation - from structuring the main navigation menus to providing contextual "Related content" links. By classifying new content against the subjects that it relates too, content creators can populate a site without having to manually add links into the site navigation or to related content.
The TMCore05 EPiServer Module consists of:
<ul>
<li>A set of editorial tools that integrate into the editorial view of an EPiServer site and provide an intuitive interface that allows content creators to classify the content they write against a topic map.</li>
<li>An integrated topic publication system that allows changes to the classification of content and to the site ontology to be published to the live site either independently or as part of the normal content approval and publication life-cycle.</li>
<li>A set of ASP.NET components which can be used to add topic map-driven navigation to EPiServer templates, providing robust subject-oriented content navigation features without any manual link management.</li>
</ul>
The TMCore05 EPiServer Module is available now. For more product details please see the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/products/episerver-module.html">product features page</a>. To request a copy of the software for evaluation please use our <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/">evaluation request form</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NetworkedPlanet's Graham Moore and Kal Ahmed have contributed some new articles to the Microsoft Architecture Journal on the subject of topic maps and topic map applications.
The <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/2005/issue5/Jour5Intro/">first article</a> appears in Journal5 and provides a general overview of the concepts behind topic maps; how those concepts are implemented in the XTM syntax; and how patterns can be applied to topic maps to create reusable application components.
The <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/2006/issue6/Jour6TopicMaps/default.aspx">second article</a> appears in Journal6 and discusses how topic maps can be applied in a number of different application scenarios including intranet and internet content management. This article also discusses the use of Web Services for integration of topic map data into wider application architectures.
These articles are also archived in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj5intro.asp">Microsoft MSDN site</a>.
You can subscribe to the print edition of the Architecture Journal and download translations in Spanish and Portuguese from <a href="http://www.architecturejournal.net/">the Architecture Journal home page</a>.
To accompany the second article, Kal has recorded a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=150161">podcast interview with Ron Jacobs</a> on MSDN's Channel 9 site. You can hear Kal and Ron discuss how topic maps can contribute to a wide range of applications and architectures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first NetworkedPlanet Briefing Day was held in Oslo this week. The briefing day attracted over 30 partners and customers of NetworkedPlanet. The directors of NetworkedPlanet, Graham Moore and Kal Ahmed, gave a series of presentations and demos to explain the company vision and to show upcoming products and technology including the features of the next version of the TMCore topic map engine, TMCore07.
The day was also used to get feedback from partners and customers on what forms of communication would be most useful. The most popular request was for a blog and subscribable feed of news from the NetworkedPlanet website. You asked for it, and here it is!
We would like to thank all the people that attended this event and especially to thank our partners <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/partners/">Bouvet</a> for allowing us to make use of their office facilities for this event.

management solution</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TMCore07 ensures information workers can find, access and organise data from disparate business systems</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compatible with .NET platforms, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint">SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://www.episerver.com">EPiServer</a> products</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Enables the Norwegian Department of Education to put its
curriculum on the internet to show parents what their children are
learning</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NetworkedPlanet, the leading vendor of information management tools and
products, has launched TMCore07, a major new enterprise-wide knowledge and
information management solution. For the first time, TMCore07 allows
organisations, such as those in finance and public sectors, to instantly find,
access and organise business-critical data from multiple systems or information
silos and deliver it to employees via an integrated knowledge network. The
solution rapidly gives information workers the relevant data and documents they
need to make better business decisions and ensures they can share insights and
knowledge across the enterprise.</p>
<p>TMCore07 is fully compatible with a range of web-service interfaces, and integrates with Microsoft SharePoint and EPiServer products. Available from just £3,000, it provides organisations with a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution for business systems integration,
web content management, and intranet-based knowledge management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our new TMCore07 solution builds upon the success of
previous versions to deliver a solution that addresses the knowledge and
information management needs of a wide range of organisations, with the added
flexibility that gives them greater scope to develop processes as the need
arises,</p>
<p>The solution loosely
couples with existing systems, so there is no invasion of established
infrastructure and it enables users to pull information from any silo within the
framework of the implementation.</p>
<p>What is more relevant for a growing number of organisations though is the linkage of information between the silos, which gives users a unique data-driven, goal-oriented approach to finding relevant information. For example, the Norwegian Department of Education have put the entire content of their national curriculum onto the internet. TMCore07
on EPiServer allows parents to search the entire content anywhere in the country to see what their children are learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right"><em>Kal Ahmed, Founder, NetworkedPlanet.</em></p>
<p>The TMCore07 solution tags key documents and information by user-selected topics and couples them with other material on the basis of specific relationships. This provides the user
with a quick and direct way to locate and present previously inaccessible data
as a single layer of information, regardless of the scale of the search.</p>
<p>TMCore is NetworkedPlanet's server platform for developing enterprise-scale knowledge and information management applications. The TMCore server stores information about any kind of "topic" - employees, departments, services, documents etc. Each topic holds information about itself, links to related documents and can also be connected to any other topic creating a knowledge web of relationships and information resources that can be browsed or searched by end-users.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>We have noticed that when downloading the TMCore EPiServer Module it is sometimes the case that the help file, <code>.chm</code> file does not open correctly.  This article explains why, and how to fix it.</strong>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Rather than tantalize and tease with the solution, to make the chm file readable on your machine open up the properties for the <code>CHM</code> file and click the <strong>Unblock</strong> button.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>The "problem" is caused by Windows protecting your system.  Windows is aware that the <code>CHM</code> file originated from the internet.  The help system, which is HTML based, contains code (ActiveX) which, if maliciously written, could damage your machine.  Therefore, Microsoft issues are security patch (896358/890175) to disable this by default.</p>
<p>In order to allow the code within the <code>CHM</code> file to run, you must "unblock" the file.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>The links below explain the exact nature of the problem and alternative workarounds to this problem.</p>

		<title>Topic Maps, SharePoint and EPiServer as an Enterprise Information Integration and Delivery Platform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Us Topic Mappers know the power of the paradigm - we can envision how the generic data model of topics maps combined with its robust treatment of identity can be used as the basis for powerful information integration solutions. However, thus far most people have seen topic maps exposed as part of a web content management system or as part of a stand alone portal.
This however, was all part of a very cunning plan. For once people see the value topic maps can bring to web site navigation and general content findability they begin to realise and think about how this paradigm, these benefits, can be applied across more information systems. They realise that Topic Maps is not just about related content links, but it is about harmonising and contextualising the access to information. Information that is distributed and heterogenous in nature. Topic Maps with one CMS application is the thin end of the wedge, the value and benefits of using Topic Maps across an organisation, across applications increase exponentially.
There is an obvious value proposition for topic maps, it is the glue that binds information together. The value of a single piece of information is only as useful as the means for people to find and utilise it. Thus the value of a CMS or a Web CMS is fundamentally limited unless the mechanism by which users can find content is effective. Topic Maps, this semantic binding, adds meaning to information, provides context to access and enables a semantic layer that people can interact with before delving into the depths of one of many information repositories.
Let's consider an example of how Topic Maps is the glue that binds information together. TMCore already integrates with SharePoint and EPiServer. One common problem is that people want to collaborate and create content in SharePoint but then hook it into the intranet or internet site that is published via EPiServer. In addition, they want to provide a unified Web Service for accessing all content to enable other systems to integrate.
TMCore and Topic Maps provide a topic based information glue that can hold this web of information together in a way that allows it to be exploited in many different applications and forms.
The basic metaphor is that there are two kinds of topics, there are concept topics, people, places, departments, skills, projects etc and there are content topics. Content topics are topics that are proxies for a document or piece of content in some content repository.
When content is created in any system that is hooked into the topic map technology a new topic is created. This topic is uniquely identified and can unambiguously locate, fetch or more commonly, address the piece of content that it represents.
When content is created or modified users or auto-classificaiton features can connect the topic that represents the content item to topics that are in the concept space (the people, projects, skills etc).
Now, in either EPiServer or SharePoint it is possible to query the topic map to find topics and content that are located nearby in the semantic space. The key thing here is that the amount of classification to achieve a high degree of interconnected topics is very low (4 or 5 connections between a content topic and concept topic is enough). All of this information can be rendered as clickable links that either display a page for another topic or can go directly to a content item stored in a content repository.
Furthermore, as all the binding information is in the topic map, it can be used to support the implementation of web services that provide unified access to all information is a given set of systems.
These are just a few ideas on how Topic Maps and TMCore can be used as way to deliver seamless enterprise information.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NPCL is the Networked Planet Constraint Language, a simple model for defining constraints on a topic map such as the topics that can be used as topic, association, role and occurrence types; what occurrence types a topic type allows, how topics can be combined in associations and so on. You can read more about NPCL <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/introducing-tmcore07/#npcl" title="Introducing TMCore07">here</a>.
An NPCL schema can be specified as an XML file or as topics and associations in a topic map. When specified in a topic map, there are a few predefined topics that are required. Normally the Networked Planet Topic Map Editor application will generate these predefined topics for you, but occassionally you will want to bootstrap an application without having to use the Topic Map Editor. The NPCL Base Topic Map XTM file provides these predefined topics in a form that can be imported into a TMCore database using the tmimport command line.

		<title>Displaying Related Topics in the Search Core Results Web Part</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few people have asked about how to more closely integrate the standard SharePoint Search Core Results Web Part with the related topics information that is maintained by the SharePoint Module. There are a number of different use cases, but in this post I'll focus on a common request - to be able to include related topics in the metadata returned by a text search and display them in the Search Core Results Web Part.
The procedure for doing this is actually quite simple. All you need to do is
<ol>
<li>Add the field(s) you want to display to the list of Managed Properties for the crawler.</li>
<li>Add the managed property (or properties) to the list of columns returned by the Search Core Results Web Part.</li>
<li>Update the XSLT stylesheet used to render the results.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Adding Fields to the Crawler Managed Properties</h3>
The first step is to make sure that the related topics field you want is added to the list of managed properties for the crawler. To do this you must go to the SharePoint Central Administration site and select the SSP for the web application. The click on the link Search > Search Settings and on the page that is displayed, click on the link "Metadata property mappings". This shows the following screen:
<img alt="metadata-property-mappings-page.PNG" src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/metadata-property-mappings-page.PNG" width="1024" height="768" />
Click on "Create New Managed Property". From this page you can add a new property that will be populated by the search crawler and specify which field(s) provide a value for the property. Note that you can specify multiple properties here so if you want to, you can combine the value of several different related topics fields into a single more generic property. For example on the demo news story site we have our stories classified by three related topics fields : Who, What and Where. We can choose either to create separate managed properties for each of these fields or to combine them all into a single field. I'll show this latter option in the example below.
To create the new managed property, you should enter the following information into the fields:
<b>Name and Type</b>: The name for the managed property gets used in the XML generated by the Search Core Results Web Part, so it is best to create a name string with simple ASCII characters and no spaces. For the type, select the <b>Text</b> option.
<b>Mappings to crawled properties</b>: Add mappings for the related topics field(s) you want to be indexed. Note that if you specify multiple mappings you have the choice of either adding all of the mapped values or of treating the list as a priority list of mappings that justs adds the values for the first mapped field found. (<b>NOTE:</b> If you cannot find the related topics fields in the list of crawled properties, this probably means that you have no documents with a value in this field - to fix this, create a new document or update an existing one to add a value to the related topics field, save the document (and publish it if necessary) and then run the crawler or wait for an incremental crawl or full crawl to run.).
<b>Use in Scopes</b>: Leave this box unchecked.
This is how my new managed property mapping looks - I want to map three related topics fields (ND_What, ND_Where, ND_WHo) to a single property called "Classification".
<img src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/new-managed-property.PNG" width="1024" height="768"
alt="Screenshot of the completed New Managed Property form."/>
Now run the crawler again (or wait for it to run again). You need a full crawl for this new property to get populated correctly.
<h3>Add the Managed Property to the Columns returned by the Search Core Results Web Part</h3>
To get our search to return the new managed property we just need to configure the query columns. To do this, go to the search results page and put it into edit mode:
<img src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/search-results-in-edit-mode.PNG" width="1024" height="768" alt="Screenshot of a standard Search Results tab page in edit mode."/>
Bring up the property editor for the Search Core Results Web Part and expand the section titled "Results Query Options". Edit the "Selected Columns" property in that section (it is easiest to do this by bringing up the text editor dialog for the field). Add a column definition for the new managed property. The XML is simply:
<code>&lt;Column Name="<i>Property Name</i>"/></code>
<img alt="adding-classification-column.PNG" src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/images/adding-classification-column.PNG" width="1024" height="768" />
Your query should now be returning the related topics field values in the XML that is styled by the Search Core Results Web Part - to check this you could just change the web part to use the debug stylesheet that comes with the TMCore SharePoint Module. I usually do this by uploading the debug stylesheet to a document library and then putting a link to it into the "XSL Link" property (found in the "Miscellaneous" property group). For my example site, this is what I get in the Search Results Web Part when I now use the debug stylesheet (I've highlighted the related topics field values that are returned by the new managed property):
<img src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/search-results-debug-view.PNG" width="1024" height="768" alt="The XML returned by the Search Core Results Web Part with related topics fields mapped to a managed property"/>
<h3>Use XSLT to style the results</h3>
OK, so far so easy :-). Now for the tricky bit - the value returned by the related topics fields is actually a set of 4 values for each related topic - in order, these are the topic name, the topic OID, a link to the item that the topic represents (if any) and a PSI for the topic. Each of these four values are separated with the separator string ';#'.
<pre>
&lt;classification>
The Art Of War (1.0 PUBLISHED)
;#5868
;#http://dev-server-2/what/Pages/TheArtOfWar.aspx
;#urn:x-versionsupport.networkedplanet.com:sp::...:1.0:PUBLISHED
;#;Troy (1.0 PUBLISHED)
;#5913
;#http://dev-server-2/where/Pages/Troy.aspx
;#urn:x-versionsupport.networkedplanet.com:sp::...:1.0:PUBLISHED

;#6085
;#http://dev-server-2/who/Pages/Odysseus.aspx
;#urn:x-versionsupport.networkedplanet.com:sp::...::PUBLISHED;#
&lt;/classification>
</pre>
So we need some slightly fancy XSLT to parse the field values. This is the XSLT I have come up with:
<pre>&lt;!-- Template to render a list of related topics field values -->
&lt;xsl:template name="DisplayClassification">
&lt;xsl:param name="str" />
&lt;xsl:if test='string-length($str) &gt; 0'>
-
&lt;xsl:call-template name="split">
&lt;xsl:with-param name="string" select="$str"/>
&lt;/xsl:call-template>
&lt;/xsl:if>
&lt;/xsl:template>
&nbsp;
&lt;xsl:template match="node()|@*" mode="split" name="split">
&lt;xsl:param name="string" select="string()"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="sep" select="';#'"/>
&lt;!-- Extract the first field into $tmp -->
&lt;xsl:variable name="tmp" select="substring-before($string, $sep)"/>
&lt;!-- If multiple fields are concatenated together, topics can end up with a ';'
prefix on their name.The following ensures that $topicname is stripped
of this if necessary -->
&lt;xsl:variable name="topicname">
&lt;xsl:choose>
&lt;xsl:when test="starts-with($tmp,';')">
&lt;xsl:value-of select="substring-after($tmp, ';')"/>
&lt;/xsl:when>
&lt;xsl:otherwise>
&lt;xsl:value-of select="$tmp"/>
&lt;/xsl:otherwise>
&lt;/xsl:choose>
&lt;/xsl:variable>
&lt;xsl:variable name="rest1" select="substring-after($string, $sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="topicid" select="substring-before($rest1,$sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="rest2" select="substring-after($rest1,$sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="link" select="substring-before($rest2,$sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="rest3" select="substring-after($rest2,$sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="urn" select="substring-before($rest3,$sep)"/>
&lt;xsl:variable name="nextitem" select="substring-after($rest3,$sep)"/>
&lt;!-- Render the topic and link as an HTML anchor. You could replace
this with your own rendering code -->
&lt;xsl:if test="$topicname and $link">
&lt;a>
&lt;xsl:attribute name="href">
&lt;xsl:value-of select="$link"/>
&lt;/xsl:attribute>
&lt;xsl:value-of select="$topicname"/>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/xsl:if>
&lt;!-- Check if a recursive call should be made to parse the rest of the field -->
&lt;xsl:if test="contains($nextitem,$sep)">
&lt;xsl:text>, &lt;/xsl:text>
&lt;xsl:call-template name="split">
&lt;xsl:with-param name="string" select="$nextitem"/>
&lt;/xsl:call-template>
&lt;/xsl:if>
&lt;/xsl:template>
</pre>
You can download this snippet of code from here: <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/code/render-related-topics.xslt">Download file</a>
The first template is the one that you can call from wherever you want to render a managed property that contains the value of one or more related topics fields. The <code>str</code> parameter must contain the content of the managed property to render. The second template is a recursive call that parses the first four fields from the string, extracting the values to four local variables and then renders the topic name and link as an HTML anchor element (you could replace this with your own rendering code), finally if there is at least one separator left in the rest of the field value, then it makes a recursive call that will parse the next four fields and so on until we are done.
This is the final result - in this case I'm just calling my rendering as part of the rendering for result metadata, of course you can use XSLT to render those related topics any way you like in the results list.
<img src="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontopic/search-results-with-classification.PNG" width="1024" height="768" alt="Screenshot of the final rendered results."/>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In this short article I've shown you the basic procedure for including topics from related topics fields in the main portal search results web part. With the flexibility for rendering provided by XSLT it should be possible to create a number of interesting and useful search renderings that combine full-text search with related topic information.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TMCore SharePoint Module is an integration between Microsoft SharePoint 2007 and the TMCore Information Server that allows SharePoint users to quickly and easily organise content in a SharePoint site using a topic map ontology defined and managed separately by a librarian or systems administrator.</p>
<p>Features of this first beta of the integration include:
<ul>
<li>Classify any content against the topic map - any SharePoint site, list or list item can be classified.</li>
<li>Ontology-driven classification - the classification UI uses the topic map ontology to make it easy for users to connect items to other topics and to provide only occurrence data that is relevant to the item.</li>
<li>Map SharePoint Content Types to the ontology - this makes the classification of SharePoint items almost completely automated. The administrator sets up a content type to topic type mapping that defines how content items should be classified.</li>
<li>Browse and edit associations as SharePoint meta-data - a custom field type allows administrators to add fields to SharePoint lists that reflect association infomation from the topic map. Users see these fields as hyperlinks taking them to the related item and can edit them on the normal SharePoint meta-data editing screens.</li>
<li>Suite of WebParts - a selection of web parts allow users to search or browse the topic map as well as to display or edit the details of topics.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The beta is now available for download. Please note that this software is in beta form and should be considered UNSTABLE. To perform the installation you will need to have first installed SharePoint 2007 Server and TMCore07 SP1. If you have a license for TMCore, please <a href="mailto:contact@networkedplanet.com">contact us for download details</a> for TMCore07 SP1. If you do not have a license, you can <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/">request an evaluation copy of TMCore</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Thanks to excellent feedback from our partners and our continued QA processes we are pleased to announce the update of the TMCore EPiServer Module to version 2.0.1.0</strong>

The following bugs have been fixed
<ol>
	<li>Publishing a page caused all associations to be published, even if the page at the other end of the association was unpublished.  Behaviour is changed to only publish associations where both ends of the association are published pages (or a topic without a page).</li>
	<li>Javascript error reported if calling up topic details for a topic which did not represent an EPiServer page in the EPiServer Edit mode.  This has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Copying a page in EPiServer did not cause a new GUID to be assigned or a new topic to be created.  This has been fixed.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When deploying production versions of TMCore EPiServer Module it is often the case that the editorial application works from the local browser but not a remote browser. This is because web applications by default do not allow Http Post operations. This is required by the Topic Map editor that is integrated with EPiServer. To fix this problem ensure the following is contain in the episerver web.config file.
<pre>&lt;system.web&gt;
&lt;webServices&gt;
&lt;protocols&gt;
&lt;add name="HttpPost"/&gt;
&lt;/protocols&gt;
&lt;/webServices&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
If using ASP.NET 2.0 you can apply this configuration change to only the path containing the web service by wrapping the above XML in a <em>location</em> element:
<pre>&lt;location path="NetworkedPlanet/EPiServerModule/Service"&gt;
&lt;system.web&gt;
&lt;webServices&gt;
&lt;protocols&gt;

		<title>TMCore on SQL Server 2005 Express</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/tmcore-on-sql-server-2005-express/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2007 11:32:52 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[gra]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.networkedplanet.com/?p=17</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Partners and customers have been expressing an interest in using TMCore 2007 on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/express/default.mspx">Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</a>.  Networked Planet are happy to announce that TMCore does function as expected on this platform.  However, there are some extra steps you have to perform during configuration as the Express edition is not quite so "out of the box" as Microsoft SQL Server.

Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (henceforth MSSQLEE) that is free to download, use and embed.  You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/sql/register/default.aspx">download it from Microsoft here</a>.

Once you have downloaded MSQLEE, you'll notice very quickly that this is definitely not the same as regular SQL Server.  Most immediately noticable are the lack of the Enterprise Manager and Query Analyzer tools.  Fortunately Microsoft have made available, as a separate download, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=C243A5AE-4BD1-4E3D-94B8-5A0F62BF7796">SQL Server 2005 Management Studio Express</a>, also this article, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/mgsqlexpwssmse.mspx">Managing SQL Server Express with SQL Server 2005 Management Studio Express Editon</a>, may give you some useful insights in how to use this utility.

Once you've downloaded and installed these, the next steps are to:
<ol>
	<li>Create the <code>topicmap</code> database, using Studio Express.</li>
	<li>Use Studio Express to load the database schema, <code>tmcore.sql</code>, in to the database.  See note below.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Note:</strong> When you execute <code>tmcore.sql</code> against the database you will see the following output:
<pre>(1 row(s) affected)
(1 row(s) affected)
Cannot grant, deny, or revoke permissions to sa, dbo, entity owner, information_schema, sys, or yourself.</pre>
This is a known issue which does not cause any problems with the operation of TMCore (you will see the same message when using the non-express edition of SQL Server 2005.

If using MS SQL Server this would be the end of configuration, however for MSSQLEE you will hit errors errors fairly quickly.  If you try to use TMEditor or TMWS you will most likely encounter the following error:
<blockquote>An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server.  When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)</blockquote>
By default MSSQLEE does not accept remote connections.  To enable this, you can use the SQL Server Surface Area Configuration utility to set MSSQLEE to be <em>Using both TCP/IP and named pipes</em> under the <em>Database Engine</em> -&gt; <em>Remote Connections</em> sections.  You may also need to enable SQL Server Browsing and open the firewall to accept connections on the required TCP/UDP ports.  See this Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914277">Knowledge Base Article KB914277</a> for a full description on how to do this.

Finally, the connection string in TMEditor and TMWS's <code>web.config</code> files will need updating to use a form that MSSQLEE will understand and tolerate.  It will be something in this form:
<blockquote><code>&lt;add key="networkedplanet.tmcore.dbconnect" value="Data Source=<span style="color: green;"><strong>SERVER NAME</strong></span>;Integrated Security=SSPI; Initial Catalog=<span style="color: green;">topicmap</span>" /&gt;</code></blockquote>
Where servername is of the form: <code><em>machine name</em><em>service name</em></code>.  Therefore if your host name is <code>DEMETER</code>, and you're using the default service name of <code>SQLEXPRESS</code>, you full connection string will be:
<blockquote><code>&lt;add key="networkedplanet.tmcore.dbconnect" value="Data Source=<span style="color: green;">DEMETERSQLEXPRESS</span>;Integrated Security=SSPI; Initial Catalog=<span style="color: green;">topicmap</span>" /&gt;</code></blockquote>
Once these steps are followed, and replicated for your own applications, you should find that SQL Server Express provides a quick and convenient way to use TMCore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>
We have only tested this against the <strong>EPiServer CMS RC3</strong> release. We suspect and hope it will work with subsequent RCs and we'll keep this blog up to date regarding compatability as new releases come out.

The existing documentation for installation and usage remains the same, therefore following the installation instructions provided is the correct procedure with the following addition.  There is one new configuration property called:

<code>&lt;add key="NP_TM_NPCL_Endpoint" value="http://localhost/npcl-ws/NPCLSchemaService.asmx" /&gt;</code>

This does have a default value (shown above) but in case your NPCL web service is somewhere else this is the additional line to add to the appsettings section in <code>web.config</code>.
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
If the <strong>Topic Map</strong> tab contents cannot render within the window and a scrollbar is required in Internet Explorer 7, then scrolling results in some weird behaviour in regards to the CSS.  This is a known issue in EPiServer CMS 5.</a>
<h3>Migration from TMCore EPiServer Module 2.x</h3>
We haven't done a rigorous test of this, but none of the topic map data structures have been changed and as we have used our own GUID property on EPiServer pages in the 2.0 module pulling across the EPiServer data and the topic map we do not expect any compatibility issues of this type.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NetworkedPlanet today released a patch for TMCore07 SP1. This patch affects only the database scripts for TMCore07 and TMCore07 SP1, updating those scripts to fix an error found in the implementation of a few stored procedures.
This procedures that are patched are used primarily by the NPCL subsystem and EPiServer Module. The patch is RECOMMENDED for all users of TMCore07 and REQUIRED for installation of the TMCore EPiServer Module.
The patch performs non-destructive upgrade of the database - no data is affected, only stored procedure implementations are replaced.
The TMCore07 SP1 Hotfix can be downloaded <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/tmcore/tmcore07sp1-hotfix1.zip">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="font-weight:bold">
<ul>
<li>NetworkedPlanet's topic maps-based platform to link together over 100,000 individual documents.</li>
<li>'RAMline' project to provide knowledge portal on any artist or work in musical history, from Beethoven and The Beatles to the sounds of tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
</div>
NetworkedPlanet, a leading vendor of information management tools and products, has announced an order for its TMCore information management solution from the Royal Academy of Music to power its new online multi-dimensional music index - the RAMline. The platform will provide an intelligent navigation system for what has the potential to become the largest and most comprehensive online music resource on the internet, linking profiles, discographies, performances and musical compositions of any artist or genre. The TMCore topic map engine will make it easy for users - initially academics and Academy students and in the future, music enthusiasts worldwide - to locate and browse over 100,000 individual in-house and external resources, such as sound clips, images, websites, and details of live performances.
Among the in-house resources that will be drawn together to form the site will be the Academy's existing music libraries, collections, and teaching materials, as well as new content created by its students as part of their research assignments. External resources such as online dictionaries and record company databases will also be integrated into the system. As each new resource is added, the system attaches topic, theme and relationship metadata to each one, enabling it to be categorised as part of a larger grid of files - all connected semantically.
Antony Pitts, Senior Lecturer in Creative Technology at the Royal Academy of Music, commented: "The RAMline project is hugely ambitious - it aims to bring together all of the Academy's internal and external resources, and will offer a completely new way of looking at music history. It has the potential to become the largest and most comprehensive online music resource on the internet, which will serve as a learning and research tool for our students and, in the future, a knowledge portal for the public. Using topic maps allows us to create, locate and access each resource rapidly and easily."
"The scale and nature of this project are ideal to demonstrate fully the benefits of topic maps," added Kal Ahmed, Founder of NetworkedPlanet. "As the index grows, navigation becomes more and more problematic, especially considering much of the content is stored in different locations. Adding topic maps to each resource - either when it is created or when its details are imported into the system - allows extra metadata properties to be attached to it, such as genre, date or city. A detailed 'map' can then be created between this metadata, allowing rapid navigation according to keywords, relationships and themes."
The user interface to the index will have an innovative design, with each musician, composer and work given a dynamically-generated timeline - allowing deep and powerful navigation. The TMCore server will store and manage 'topic maps' of the entire content of the RAMline. Each topic contains metadata which holds information about the file, links to related documents and links to other topics, creating a map of knowledge. This map can be browsed or searched by end-users to find information resources via key concepts. The result is a detailed index of the information resources across a number of systems via a single unified information portal.
<b>About The RAMline</b>
In 2006, the Academy began building a unique index of digitised archives and online resources, together with a specialised tool that allows this index to be browsed and searched intuitively by students, staff and visitors. As well as an ever-expanding catalogue of musicians and of musical works, the RAMline links to manuscript sources and published editions, live performances and recordings, musical criticism and comment. The RAMline simultaneously displays a timeline of musical history and the life-cycle of any piece of music, from antiquity to the present, and will be used to chart each student’s musical profile at the Academy and beyond. The RAMline is the focus of a Teaching and Research Award from the University of London's Centre for Distance Education.
<b>About the Royal Academy of Music</b>
The Royal Academy of Music is Britain's senior conservatoire, and since 1822 has prepared students for successful careers in music according to the constantly evolving demands of the profession. Academy musicians study for University of London degrees in varied programmes including instrumental performance, composition, jazz, musical theatre and opera. The Academy's student community is truly international, with over 50 countries represented. The Academy has recently invested substantially in creative technology and collaborates closely with the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Simple Organisation Ontology is a starter ontology designed to allow you to learn more about how NPCL works and to use as a starter for your own projects. The ontology has been designed around a simple intranet application. The ontology records the following topic types:
<dl>
<dt>Organisational Entity</dt>
<dd>A high-level type for departments, teams and people in an organisation. This class has the following three subclasses:
<dl>
<dt>Organisational Unit</dt>
<dd>Part of an organisation. Organisational units can be organised into a Parent Unit / Child Unit hierarchy.</dd>
<dt>Cross Functional Team</dt>
<dd>A team within an organisation that operates across the normal organisational hierarchy.</dd>
<dt>Person</dt>
<dd>An individual within an organisation. A Person can be leader of one Organisational Unit, a member of one Organisational Unit and a member of any number of Cross Functional Teams.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Content Item</dt>
<dd>This is an abstract base class for representing content such as documents, articles, memos and so on. Content Items can have any number of Project, Skill, Product or Concept topics associated as a Primary Subject or Secondary Subject. A Content Item can be an Input To or Output From a Task. A Content Item is the Responsibility Of a Person.<br/>
The Content Item class is marked as abstract, so users should choose one of the concrete base classes when creating their topics. The concrete subclasses defined in this ontology are:
<dl>
<dt>Document</dt>
<dd>Used to represent an internal document such as an MS Word document or Excel spreadsheet.</dd>
<dt>Article</dt>
<dd>Used to represent short content items that are intended for wider consumption. Typically these will be items written for public dissemination (e.g. content published on a website).</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Concept</dt>
<dd>Represents any concept that is relevant to the business. This topic type is taken from
the Techquila definition for thesaurus construction. If you wish to arrange concepts into a thesaurus structure, you may want to add our Simple Thesaurus Ontology to your topic map.</dd>
<dt>Product</dt>
<dd>A product used or created by the organisation. A Product is the Responsibility Of an Organisational Entity</dd>
<dt>Project</dt>
<dd>A project carried out by the organisation or some part of it. A Project is the Responsibility Of an Organisational Entity. A Project Works On a Product. A Project Has zero or more Tasks. </dd>
<dt>Task</dt>
<dd>Work carried out by an individual or group of individuals. A Task can be Assigned To zero or more People. A Task can have any number of Input Documents and any number of Output Documents. A Task can be Part Of a Project.</dd>
<dt>Skill</dt>
<dd>A Person Has any number of Skills. Skills can be arranged in a Parent Skill/Child Skill hierarchy.</dd>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This ontology provides a simple concept-based thesaurus structure for use in your projects. The ontology implements most of the Topic Per Concept Thesaurus Pattern described in the <a href="http://www.techquila.com/tmsinia_5.html">Techquila article on Topic Maps Design Patterns</a>.
Under this pattern, the thesuarus is represented as a collection of topics representing Concepts. Each Concept topic should have one base name in the unconstrained scope giving the preferred term for the topic (additional non-preferred terms can be added as base names scoped by the Non-Preferred Term scoping topic). Concepts are related to one another using the Concept Relationship association (for related concepts) or the Broader-Narrower association (for parent-child relationships).
This simple version of the Techquila ontology omits the Part-Whole association type. The types presented in this version are:
<dl>
<dt>Concept</dt>
<dd>Topic Type. A thesaurus entry representing a concept. Concepts can be connected together using the Broader/Narrower association (to create hierarchical relationships) or the Concept Relationship association (to create cross-cutting relationships). Each concept can have any number of Warrant, Scope Note, Editor Note, General Note, History Note or Hierarchy Note occurrences.</dd>
<dt>Warrant</dt>
<dd>Occurrence Type that holds information about the source warrant for the concept. The warrant usually refers to the authoritative source document that the concept and its preferred term was taken from.</dd>
<dt>Scope Note</dt>
<dd>An Occurrence Type that holds information about the concept. Several subclasses are defined for specific types of scope note.
<dl>
<dd>History Note</dd>
<dt>A note providing historical information about the entry - e.g. when it was first added or last updated.</dt>
<dd>Hierarchy Note</dd>
<dt>A note providing information about the hierarchical placement of the entry in the thesaurus hierarchy.</dt>
<dd>General Note</dd>
<dt>A note providing general information about the thesaurus entry.</dt>
<dd>Editor Note</dd>
<dt>A note providing editors with information about the entry. For example, a note indicating that the entry should be reviewed.</dt>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Non-Preferred Term</dt>
<dd>A Scoping Topic that can be used to scope base names on Concept topics that define the non-preferred terms for the concept.</dd>

		<title>Ontology-driven Application Design with the NPCL Schema Editor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/networkedplanet-announce-visual-topic-map-schema-editor/" title="NetworkedPlanet Announce Visual Topic Map Schema Editor">new release of the NPCL Schema Editor</a>, the focus of our developer tool set is now moving around to <strong>ontology-driven application design</strong>. This post is to explain a little more about what that concept involves and how we think it can provide real benefit to system architects and developers alike.
<h2>Ontology and Information Management</h2>
Our key focus has always been on Information Management - enabling organizations to better organize the information that they work with to make it more accessible, more relevant to key processes and better connected to the concepts that drive the business. Adding ontologies into the mix strengthens the connections between information assets and concepts by enabling the business concepts to be made as concrete as the documents and databases that are part of the business. An ontology can also provide a means for expressing the common consensus on "what exists in our business", "what do we do" and "what are our key business drivers, goals and concepts" - in that alone the development of an ontology can be a key part of examining and improving business processes.
<h2>An Ontology-based Application Development Process</h2>
There are many stages of the application development life-cycle where ontologies can play a key role. These  are the principle ones that we have seen from our exeperience in developing information management solutions using topic maps.
<h3>Design To Ontology</h3>
An ontology represents a concrete specification of the classes of concepts and relationships that are involved in a particular system architecture. By creating an ontology with "Person", "Company", "Document" and other topic types we are explicitly saying that these concept classes are a key part of the system architecture. In many cases these conceptual classes will persist all the way down into the data layer. Of course, in the old days that meant creating database tables, but with topic maps the possibility of a more flexible approach is opened up.
Furthermore with a constraint language for topic maps such as NPCL, we can take the high-level concept classes and encode them directly in a syntax that the topic map processor can understand and act on. In this way we can really start the process of coding a system by writing the ontology - it is the first step on the road to making our conceptual designs a concrete reality.
A constraint language also allows us to express more about our model than a simple system of types. Constraints enable us to specify how those types interact and combine and impose minimum requirements for data integrity.
<h3>Ontology to Code</h3>
Ontology and code can interface in many different ways.
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Access To Ontology</strong><br/>
At the simplest you can use code to acess the ontology information. In TMCore, this feature is provided by the NPCL library and the supporting database views that enable running code to query and traverse ontology information. In this way code can be written that is designed to work flexibly with different domain models by allowing the ontology to specify how it behaves. A simple example of this is the UI for populating a topic with occurrence values. An ontology-unaware application will have to prompt the user to search for the occurrence type and will have no way of validating that the occurrence type and its value make sense for the topic (specifying two Age occurrences with different values on a Person topic for example). An ontology-aware application could know that a Person topic is only allowed one Age occurrence, that the value for this occurrence must be a non-negative integer and that the value must be less than 130.
</li>
<li><strong>Ontology-Driven Queries</strong><br />
An ontology specifies both the types and the relationships between them. Therefore it is easy to see that it should be possible to create ontology-driven query interfaces that allow users to develop queries that traverse an topic map instance based on the types and relationships specified in the ontology and without the need for a lot of specialised knowledge about how that information is stored. ISO is working on a standardised query language for topic map queries known as TMCL, but even this is working from the principle of being ontology-unaware. An ontology-aware application will ensure that users only ever create "meaningful" queries (queries that could possibly return at least one result) and can avoid the need for users to know the underlying identifiers assigned to the types in the ontology. We have already implemented an initial version of this idea in the TMCore SharePoint Module where a simple web-form UI allows a user to construct a query as a series of "hops" through the topic map with optional filtering at each stage of the hop. The ontology-aware query editor form ensures that the user can only select an appropriate relationship type for the next hop based on the type(s) returned by the previous hop.
</li>
<li><strong>Ontology-based Code Generation</strong><br />
An initial version of our ideas on code generation was shown at the TMRA conference last year (and is written up in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leveraging-Semantics-Topics-Maps-International/dp/354071944X/ref=sr_1_1/026-2065107-6402822?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187087575&sr=8-1">"Leveraging the Semantics of Topic Maps"</a>. Code generation holds many promises - not least of which is reducing the burden on the application developer by removing (or reducing) the need to write the classes that represent the key entities in the solution and allowing them instead to focus on the business logic. Combine this with the ability of a flexible schema language like NPCL to allow domain-specific constraints to be expressed in the schema itself and gradually it should be possible to move more and more of the commonly coded elements of solutions into simple configuration of properties in a schema.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ontology to UI</h3>
I have already mentioned how an ontology-aware user interface can provide input validation, but the advantages of ontology-based application development do not stop there. As many of our applications tend to be web-based and/or forms-based, the ontology can be used as the intial specification of the layout of the various presentational forms. We will shortly be releasing an example of this for the TMCore SharePoint Module which uses the annotated ontology to generate SharePoint content types and fields which in turn automatically produces the forms representations for those items in the SharePoint interface.
Future work in this area will also look at the possibility of auto-generating all kinds of page layouts and windows forms as well as web forms.
<h2>Conclusion: The Future For Ontology-Driven Applications</h2>
The release of the NPCL Schema Editor is the first step in enabling the vision of speeding up the development of complex information management solutions through the application of simple  topic map schemas. By building on a solid base of Topic Maps, TMCore, NPCL and now the visual editor tool we will be bringing our developer community more and better tooling to help in code generation, query generation, application and UI configuration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This note applies to version 2.0 of the TMCore SharePoint Module.
<strong>Problem</strong>
It has been reported that in Norwegian language installations of the TMCore SharePoint Module, when a Related Topics Field is displayed in a list view, the column renders an unexpected value string "#VERDI!". This issue has been tracked down to the CAML rendering for Related Topics Fields and a fix can be implemented quite easily.
<strong>Fix</strong>
To fix this problem:
<ol>
<li>Locate the file fldtypes_topicmap.xml. This file will be in the 12TEMPLATESXML directory of your SharePoint installation (typically C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft Sharedweb server extensions12TEMPLATESXMLfldtypes_topicmap.xml).</li>
<li>Open the file in a text editor application such as Notepad or Visual Studio and replace all instances of the string #VALUE! with the string #VERDI!. There should be three such instances to replace.</li>
<li>Save the file and restart IIS to force a re-read of the configuration file.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ViewState MAC Validation errors in TMEditor</h1>
If you've used TMEditor on Windows 2003 you may have experienced the following error when using TMEditor:
<div style="color:red;text-decoration:italic">Validation of viewstate MAC failed. If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster, ensure that  configuration specifies the same validationKey and validation algorithm. AutoGenerate cannot be used in a cluster.</div>
There are several reasons why this may happen; however there is a general way around this problem which is to disable ViewState MAC validation.  To do this edit the TMEditor's <code>web.config</code> file and add the following as a child of the <code>system.web</code> section:
<pre>&lt;pages enableEventValidation="false" viewStateEncryptionMode="Never" enableViewStateMac="false" /&gt;</pre>
However please note that this may allow attacks on the application or IIS on a public-facing server; however if you've got TMEditor sitting unprotected on an internet connection then you're already in trouble <code>:-)</code>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NetworkedPlanet have today released the first version of the NPCL Schema Editor for Visual Studio 2005. This freely-downloadable add-in for Microsoft's Visual Studio product provides developers and information architects with a graphical tool for defining a topic map schema (often also referred to as an ontology) using the Networked Planet Constraint Language (NPCL).
The tool enables the schema developer to create a new schema using simple drag-and-drop operations and to visualise schemas graphically. The output of the tool is an XML file which can then be directly imported into the TMCore Information Management Server where it can be used to generate ontology-driven interfaces for topic map editing.
The schema language NPCL is now used in all of NetworkedPlanet's information integration products including the integrations with EPiServer and Microsoft SharePoint. By making it easier to develop a schema language it is our hope that developers and architects will be able to make better use of the power that lies behind ontology-driven development.
Future extensions to the editor are planned to support direct generation of SharePoint and EPiServer-based solutions from an annotated ontology.
For the developer's low-down on the NPCL Schema Editor please see the postings on our OnTopic blog.
<strong>Update</strong>
Thanks to bug reports from a couple of early adopters of the NPCL Schema Editor. There is now an updated version available for download. If you have a previous version of the schema editor installed you must first uninstall it using Add/Remove Programs before installing the new version.
The NPCL Schema Editor version 1.0.0.2 is now available for <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/npclschemaeditor/npclschemaeditor-1.0.0.2.zip">free download from here</a>.
If you do find any issues with installing or using the software, please contact us at contact@networkedplanet.com.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Indiepix launches world’s largest collection of downloadable independent films</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Powered by state-of-the-art topic maps software from NetworkedPlanet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Offers unique film exploration and navigation capability</strong></li>
</ul>
Indiepix, a world leading online service created for the independent film community,
has launched one of the most comprehensive independent film resource on the Internet, powered by state of the art navigation software from NetworkedPlanet, the leading vendor of information management tools. Visitors to www.indiepix.net will now, for the first time, be able to discover, explore and purchase more than 3,000 independent films, as well as learn about new films, all classified by Indiepix’s movie experts. Indiepix will give 60 per cent of the profit/revenue from purchase straight to the film-maker, to help support the independent film industry and encourage the production of more movies.
Indiepix is a rapidly expanding organisation – it plans to grow its film library to over 10,000 within the first 18 months of the launch. The service is powered by NetworkedPlanet’s TMCore information management system which provides the state-of-the-art interactive services for customers. NetworkedPlanet’s powerful topic mapping navigation system will enable an increasing number of independent film enthusiasts to find out more about their favourite genres or directors, as well as access rare or hard-to-find films. The new Indiepix service will support independent film-makers by giving 60 per cent of the profits/revenue from every sale through the site back to the film-makers, which will help encourage the development of future projects as well as maintain existing ones.
“This project is designed to open up new opportunities for exploring the world of independent film,” commented Bob Alexander, President of Indiepix. “The new Indiepix site will provide an avenue for independent films to get greater recognition and we will contribute a majority of profits back to the film-makers themselves. It is important that the site is easy to navigate, and that it can recommend new films, directors and actors that visitors may not have heard of – this is by far the best way to encourage greater participation in the independent film industry. NetworkedPlanet understood our objectives from the outset, which is a major factor in why we are now able to launch the most comprehensive resource for independent film on the Internet.”
Each film on the site will contain metadata attachments that allow IndiePix’s in-house team of film experts to insert all sorts of information – who directed it, which country it was filmed in, the reviews it had at release – based on their expertise and evaluation of it. The system will then use TMCore to create relevant links between them, so that when someone is browsing any one film online, it will suggest other links based on relevance and similarities. Once all of the films have this data attached to them, the resulting knowledge base can be easily and intelligently navigated by anyone using the website.
“This project is a great example of how topic maps can be used to enhance online navigation,” commented Kal Ahmed, Founder of NetworkedPlanet. “The system functions in a similar way to a shopkeeper in a clothes store – a customer might have selected a blue shirt, so the shopkeeper suggests they look at similar shirts, as well as cuff-links and ties that match it. IndiePix.net now does the same thing for people who are shopping for independent films.”
TMCore is NetworkedPlanet’s server platform for developing enterprise knowledge and information management applications. The TMCore server will store and manage topic maps of the entire content of a website. Each topic contains metadata which holds information about the file, links to related documents and links to other topics, creating a map of knowledge. This map can be browsed or searched by end-users to find information via key concepts. The result is a detailed index of the resources across a number of systems via a single unified information portal.
<u>About IndiePix</u>
Founded in 2004 in New York, IndiePix is a world leading shop and online service created for the independent film community. It is a group of movie experts, information professionals, media arts specialists, and most importantly, committed supporters of independent film.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some of our customers have reported problems with the EPiServer Module 3.1 BETA for EPiServer 5 CMS.  Namely whenever the TMCoreEPiDataService.asmx web service is invoked the following error is produced:
<code>2008-01-11 14:25:51,959 ERROR [18] EPiServer.Global.Global_Error - 1.2.5 Unhandled exception in ASP.NET
System.Web.HttpException: The HTTP verb POST used to access path '/NetworkedPlanet/EPiServerModule/Service/TMCoreEPiDataService.asmx/GetTopicNameAndType' is not allowed.
at System.Web.DefaultHttpHandler.BeginProcessRequest(HttpContext context, AsyncCallback callback, Object state)
at System.Web.HttpApplication.CallHandlerExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute()
at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean&amp; completedSynchronously)</code>
This error is caused by a bug in EPiServer that will be fixed in EPiServer CMS 5 SP1.
EPiServer's explanation of the problem and 2 workarounds are posted here: <del datetime="2013-04-03T14:53:55+00:00">http://www.episerver.com/en/EPiServer_Knowledge_Center/FAQ_EPiServer_4/956/Invoking-WebService-operations-in-IIS5-causes-an-HttpException/</del>
This problem does not affect users deploying EPiServer solutions in a local ASP.NET development server.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A bug was discovered in the recently released TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0 that affects the Topic Creator selectors. This hotfix addresses that issue.
<strong>Systems Affected</strong>
This bug will occur on any installation of the TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0 downloaded before 8th March 2008. If you downloaded your copy of the software from our site on or after this date, the hotfix is included in the package and you do not need to apply it again.
To determine if your system is affected, check the File Version property of the assembly NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint in the GAC (browse to C:WindowsASSEMBLY, locate the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly, right-click and choose Properties. The File Version can be found on the Version tab above Description and Copyright). This bug affects File Version 2.0.0.0 of this file.
<strong>Symptoms</strong>
The bug shows up when the user clicks on the a configured Topic Creator link from a related topics field. A dialog window appears, but no content is displayed in the window.
<strong>Fix Procedure</strong>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/spmodule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.0.Hotfix1.zip">Hotfix1 package</a>.</li>
<li>The package is provided in a compressed ZIP file. Unzip the package on a machine in the server farm. The package contains a single file named NPSharePoint.wsp. This is an updated copy of the SharePoint Solution package provided with the 3.0 release of the TMCore SharePoint Module.</li>
<li>Use stsadm to upgrade the NPSharePoint.wsp solution on the server. The exact command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but in any case it must include the -allowgacdeployment option. A sample command line would be:<br/><code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPSharePoint.wsp -filename NPSharePoint.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code></li>
<li>After applying this update it may be necessary to restart IIS.</li>
</ol>
If you have any questions about this hotfix or require any further support, please contact us at support@networkedplanet.com.

		<title>Ontology based site design in SharePoint</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology-based-site-design-in-sharepoint/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
We've talked previously, <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/tm-website-architecture.pdf">Topic Map website architectures</a> about how topic maps can be used in terms of websites, we have also talked before about <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology-driven-application-design-with-the-npcl-schema-editor/"> Ontology driven application design.</a>  I'm going to pick up a couple of threads and reflect on how  defining an Ontology can be useful in the construction of a SharePoint 2007 site.
</p>
<p>First, what do we mean by a SharePoint site design? We consider it to be the definition of content types, lists and sites within a site collection. This really comes down to the kinds of items you are going to have and the organising principles you are going, impose, er, provide for users to navigate the site. We aren't talking about the look and feel aspect of design.</p>
<p>Next, whats an Ontology? I'm going to use the definition that its, <i>the types of things and the types of relationships between those things that exist in a particular domain according to some view point.</i> So, no controlled vocabularies here, although they may be implied, no instance data, just the types of things. Kind of like a class diagram in UML, or a Logical Entity Relationship Model.</p>
<p>The power of the ontology is that it immediately frees you from the bounds of the technology. While SharePoint things (items, documents, sites and users) have some properties in common they are in fact all quite different beasts. They have different representations, different APIs, different event models and of course varying degrees of default functionality associated with them.This means when doing site design you are instantly forced to think about, and quickly choose, the king of SharePoint thing to use. I call this the technology committment. The technology committment always trumps the design aesthetic because if it can't be done, or costs to much to be done, it won't get done. Enter Ontology driven site design.</p>
<p>Ontology driven site design is a Zen like experience where the designers can concentrate on the true nature of the information management problem at hand. They can consider all the actors, artifacts, and concepts in a holistic fashion. They do not need to worry about the issues that people manifest themselves as accounts in Active Directory, or that products some from a third party web service feed, or that documents and tasks will use the base SharePoint types for these artifacts. Without these technical constraints they are free to define the types and more importantly, the relationships between these types in ways that directly help tackle the information management issues facing the different users of the system. Furthermore, its possible to ignore the strict hierarchy that is imposed by SharePoint and think about information access purely in terms of the logical model. This of course could contain multiple hierarchical structures and will almost certainly be graph like in nature.</p>
<p>One final little point is that the SharePoint tooling is lacking any overview capability of 'how it all fits together' using an ontology as the basis for the site provides clear documentation to all involved in the project. This artifact can be used in design meetings, data integration meetings and of course site implementation.</p>
<p>So if its all so Zen, so technology agnostic how useful is it beyond documentation? Well, of course you need some technology to make this happen, and this is SharePoint so of course you want to make use of all the SharePoin features. This is where Topic Maps comes in and specifically, the TMCore SharePoint Module. There are two key things Topic Maps integrated with SharePoint via our tools does for you. Firstly, using the NPCL Visual Studio plugin its possible to draw and visualise an ontology. Then, while still inside Visual Studio its possible to either connect the types in the ontology to existing SharePoint content types or to indicate that new types should be created. Finally, the plugin will allow you to generate a feature that contains all the Content type definitions, the ontology and the relationship between the two. </p>
<p>The second thing the Topic Maps integration provides is some basic plumbing inside SharePoint such that all SharePoint items can have a related Topic. Once we have flattened the shape of all things in SharePoint to be just topics and associations its possible to truly realise the Zen ontology while still utilising all the things that the different shaped SharePoint things give you.</p>
<p>Creating this highly connected, semantically organised graph of concepts is great but only if you can then utilise it for the benefit of users. This can be done in a number of ways but one of the most powerful is to develop queries over the logical ontology in order to provide multiple navigation paths to the same content, contextualised lists of topics, or documents based on the user and their situation, finally perhaps making use of the notion of faceted search to slice and dice through the information.</p>
<p>Ontology design needs to be a proper part of the design process. It should happen early on in the project in conjunction with use case and system integration iterations. It's key that these things happen at the same time, as the logical model the ontology provides is the tool for delivering the use cases and the target for mapping in information from other systems.</p>
<p>Ontology driven design for SharePoint has some basic practical advantages over developing the site through the administration interfaces or XML features. Furthermore, it empowers a much more natural and powerful way to think about, organise and exploit the content and concepts of a given domain or application.</p>
<p>To see all of this in action we have produced some cool vidoes of ontology design in the context of SharePoint site design. They can be found <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/products/sharepointmodule/videos.shtml">here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A new hotfix package is available for version 3.0 of the TMCore SharePoint Module. This package addresses a number of bugs and provides a couple of additional enhancements for site developers. The full change list can be found <a href="#changelog">below</a>.
<strong>Systems Affected</strong>
This bug will occur on any installation of the TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0 downloaded before 21st March 2008. If you downloaded your copy of the software from our site on or after this date, the hotfix is included in the package and you do not need to apply it again.
To determine if your system is affected, check the File Version property of the assembly NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint in the GAC (browse to C:WindowsASSEMBLY, locate the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly, right-click and choose Properties. The File Version can be found on the Version tab above Description and Copyright). This hotfix updates the File Version of the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly to 2.0.0.2 - if the file version shown is greater than or equal to 2.0.0.2, then you do not need to apply this hotfix.
<strong>Installation Instructions</strong>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/spmodule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.0.Hotfix2.zip">Hotfix2 package</a>.</li>
<li>The package is provided in a compressed ZIP file. Unzip the package on a machine in the server farm. The package contains the following files:
<ul>
<li>NPSharePoint.wsp. This is an updated copy of the SharePoint Solution package provided with the 3.0 release of the TMCore SharePoint Module.</li>
<li>NPOfficeServer.wsp. This is an updated copy of the SharePoint Solution package provided with the 3.0 release of the TMCore SharePoint Module.</li>
<li>Docs. This directory contains the updated Site Developers Guide documentation.</li>
<li>Stylesheets. This directory contains the updated base stylesheets for site developers.</li>
<li>NPCLEditor. This directory contains the updated NPCL Schema Editor extensions for the TMCore SharePoint Module</li>
</ul>
<li>Use stsadm to upgrade the NPSharePoint.wsp and NPOfficeServer.wsp solutions on the server. The exact command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but in any case it must include the -allowgacdeployment option. A sample command line would be:<br/>
<code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPSharePoint.wsp -filename NPSharePoint.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code><br/>
<code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPOfficeServer.wsp -filename NPOfficeServer.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code><br/>
</li>
<li>After applying the solution updates it may be necessary to restart IIS.</li>
<li>To install the updates to the NPCL Schema Editor extensions, simply copy the contents of the NPCLEditorExtensions directory to the local extensions directory on your development machine (typically <code>C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication Data
NetworkedPlanetNPCLEditorExtensions</code>).</li>
</ol>
<a name="changelog"><strong>Change Log</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>BUGFIX: TwoHopQueryWebPart is now properly security filtering both the
TargetTopic and the ViaTopic.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Modified the sample TwoHopQueryWebPart stylesheets so that they
render in a meaningful way even if there is no CSS associated with their CSS
class. Each grouped list now renders as a &lt;strong> tag  wrapped around the
group header and a &lt;ul> containing &lt;li> tags for each member of the group
</li><li>
BUGFIX: Fixed an error in the EnterpriseServices.SocialTagging module that
caused the creation of a new tag to take a long time to complete. Creating new
tags in the social tagging web parts should now be much faster.
</li><li>
BUGFIX: Fixed the ItemAdded event handler to ensure proper completion when the
NPItemBase feature is not activated.
</li><li>
BUGFIX: Topic names for topics that represent SharePoint list items are now
generated from the formatted representation of the SharePoint field configured
by the Topic Type Mapping. This change ensures that calculated fields are
rendered as just their formatted string value.
</li><li>
BUGFIX: Fixed rendering of Source attributes in Related Topics Field links in
views to render a full URL rather than a web-relative URL.
</li><li>ENHANCEMENTS: Enhancements made to the NPCL Schema Editor Extensions to ensure
more consistent editing of features that are already deployed to a server. The
enhancements should make it much easier to update a test deployment of features
generated using the NPCL Schema Editor extensions.
</li><li>ENHANCEMENT: Modified the Associated Topic Field properties editor to allow
the name of the form used by a Topic Creator to be entered in a text field
rather than chosen from a drop-down list of forms. This enables the use of
forms other than those contained in the list (e.g. forms from _layouts)
for the creation of items.
</li>
</ul>
This hotfix also rolls in the fixes previously provided in <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/sharepoint-module-topic-creator-hotfix/">Hotfix1</a>.

		<title>NetworkedPlanet Announce Release of SharePoint Module 3.0</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/networkedplanet-announce-release-of-sharepoint-module-3-0/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>03/03/2008, NetworkedPlanet are pleased to annouce the release of the much anticipated TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0.</p>
<p>This release sees a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, but more significantly it includes a large number of features that greatly improve the way information is organised, classified and located with Microsoft SharePoint solutions.</p>
<p>The new key features can be grouped into several different areas: </p>
<h4>Ontology Design</h4>
<p>Creating a well-designed ontology is the most important first step in designing a complete information architecture that can integrate SharePoint and non-SharePoint content into a cohesive and logical whole.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the new NetworkedPlanet NPCL Editor plugin for Visual Studio to visually define an ontology for a complete SharePoint solution. Use the integration with SharePoint web services to create SharePoint content types and fields.</li>
<li>The NPCL Editor plugin can also generate a SharePoint feature to allow the topic map ontology, any additional taxonomy and the SharePoint content types and field definitions to be reliably deployed in multiple server environments such as Development, QA, and Production.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Content Classification and Organisation</h4>
<p>The new release makes it very easy to organise and classify content against taxonomies, controlled vocabularies and in terms of other SharePoint items regardless of which site or list they are in. The TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0 is designed to normalise the information space so that items can be more logically connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>New ways to find and select related topics; Hierarchy Selectors, Query Selectors, and Creators</li>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchy Selectors, allow users to choose related topics from tree structures defined in the topic map. These may be fixed taxonomy trees or user-generated trees that result from the creation of other item to item relationships.</li>
<li>Query Selectors, allow developers to define specific, contextual queries that return a candidate list for the user to select from. Query Selectors allow almost any specific business logic about the most appropriate related topics for a given context to be defined.</li>
<li>Creators provide a unique way to create a new SharePoint item (even one in another list or on another site) while editing an existing item. This feature removes the need for the user to constantly navigate from one list to another creating items before they can be hooked together. </li>
</ul>
<li>Simple tagging support. Optional support for ad-hoc "tagging" of content is now supported across all SharePoint list and content types. This feature allows users to get started easily tagging and organising content using their own terms and allows a community of users to collaborate on building a folksonomy for the classification of their content. </li>
<li>Social Networking Features. A user's ad-hoc tags can be automatically shared with her colleagues and with other trusted users.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Searching and Navigating in SharePoint</h4>
<p>Also new with version 3.0 of the TMCore SharePoint Module is the introduction of the Topic Map Index Service. This near-real time, in-memory index of Topic Map information means that complex information queries can be executed with a high throughput to deliver up-to-the-second information from across the portal.</p>
<p>The Topic Map Index Service is used to power a number of search and navigation web parts that make it possible to effectively find your way around a SharePoint portal.</p>
<ul>
<li>One Hop and Two Hop navigtaion controls can be used to show relevant contextual information about any SharePoint item.</li>
<li>Advanced Faceted Search. Utilising a combination of hieararchy and topic type pickers this web part can be used to slice and dice through SharePoint content to allow users to find what they are really looking for.</li>
<li>Advanced Faceted Search integrated with text search. The Advanced Faceted Search web parts can be used to slice and dice the results of a SharePoint portal text search.</li>
</ul>

<b>Cannot connect to SharePoint site from the NPCL editor.</b><br/>
<p>
When using the NPCL Editor Extensions provided with the TMCore SharePoint Module to map topic types in the ontology to content types, you may be presented with a log-in dialog to connect to the SharePoint site to retrieve a list of content types or field types. If you are connecting to the SharePoint site as a domain user, the dialog requires a domain and user name to log in, you must enter this full log-in name in the form <i>domain/user</i>, rather than the more usual <i>domainuser</i> form.
</p>
<p>NOTE: From Hotfix 4 for the TMCore SharePoint Module, this fix will be included in the installation package.</p>

<b>ASP.NET Error when attempting to enable List Auto-classification</b><br/>
<p>When using the link from a List Settings page to enable Auto-classification on the list, you may encounter the following ASP.NET error:</p>
<pre>
Multiple controls with the same ID
'ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ctl05$ctl01$RptControls$EnableAutoClassification' were
found. Trace requires that controls have unique IDs.
</pre>
<p>This error message is caused because two different elements of the NPClassification feature accidently use the same Id value. To fix this on an existing installation, follow these steps on each server in the server farm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the NPClassification feature directory. It will be under the SharePoint 12 directory (12TEMPLATEFEATURESNPClassification).</li>
<li>Using Notepad or another text editor, open the file ListClassificationFeatureElements.xml</li>
<li>On the <code>CustomAction</code> element, change the value of the <code>Id</code> attribute from <code>EnableAutoClassification</code> to <code>ClassifyList</code>.</li>
<li>Save the XML file and restart IIS.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: From Hotfix 4 for the TMCore SharePoint Module, this fix will be included in the installation package.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A new hotfix package is available for version 3.0 of the TMCore SharePoint Module. This package addresses a number of bugs and performance issues. The full change list can be found <a href="#changelog">below</a>.
<strong>Systems Affected</strong>
This hotfix should be applied to any installation of the TMCore SharePoint Module 3.0 downloaded before 2nd June 2008. If you downloaded your copy of the software from our site on or after this date, the hotfix is included in the package and you do not need to apply it again.
To determine if your system is affected, check the File Version property of the assembly NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint in the GAC (browse to C:WindowsASSEMBLY, locate the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly, right-click and choose Properties. The File Version can be found on the Version tab above Description and Copyright). This hotfix updates the File Version of the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly to 2.0.0.4 - if the file version shown is greater than or equal to 2.0.0.4, then you do not need to apply this hotfix.
<strong>Installation Instructions</strong>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/spmodule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.0.Hotfix4.zip">Hotfix4 package</a>.</li>
<li>The package is provided in a compressed ZIP file. Unzip the package on a machine in the server farm. The package contains the following files:
<ul>
<li>NPSharePoint.wsp. This is an updated copy of the SharePoint Solution package provided with the 3.0 release of the TMCore SharePoint Module.</li>
<li>NPOfficeServer.wsp. This is an updated copy of the SharePoint Solution package provided with the 3.0 release of the TMCore SharePoint Module.</li>
</ul>
<li>Use stsadm to upgrade the NPSharePoint.wsp and NPOfficeServer.wsp solutions on the server. The exact command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but in any case it must include the -allowgacdeployment option. A sample command line would be:<br/>
<code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPSharePoint.wsp -filename NPSharePoint.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code><br/>
<code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPOfficeServer.wsp -filename NPOfficeServer.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code><br/>
</li>
<li>After applying the solution updates it may be necessary to restart IIS.</li>
<li>If you have installed the NPCL Editor Extensions for the TMCore SharePoint Module,
copy the contents of the NPCLEditorExtensions directory to the extensions
installation directory for NPCL Editor. The path to the extensions directory
will depend on your installation but will typically be either:
<code>C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataNetworkedPlanetNPCLEditorExtensions</code> or
<code>C:Documents and Settings{User Name}Application DataNetworkedPlanetNPCLEditorExtensions</code>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="changelog"><strong>Change Log</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>DOCS: Added documentation of the list Auto-classification feature to the Site
Developers Guide.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: _ITEM_URL_ column now returns the correct URL for links to items on
nested sites.</li>
<li>BUGFIX[695]: Fixed a security exception in the ItemDeleted event handler that
could cause topics to not get deleted from the topic map when the
item is deleted via a site that uses forms-based authentication.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed content type mapping lookup to take account of URL mappings in
NPUrlMap.xml. This means that when using extended sites, there is now
no need to duplicate the content type mappings.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed reporting of TopicMapIndexClient connection errors to include
stack trace.</li>
<li>BUGFIX[685]: Fixed CustomAction Id clash that occasionally caused ASP.NET
errors when displaying List Settings on a site with the
NPClassification feature enabled.</li>
<li>BUGFIX[690]: Fixed the login dialog for the NPCL Editor extensions to accept
user names in the traditional &lt;domain>&lt;user> form instead of
&lt;domain>/&lt;user></li>
<li>ENHANCEMENT: Web parts and AssociatedTopicsFields now use a common cache for
context topics during page request processing. This will reduce
the number of database queries required to display pages/list
items that have multiple query web parts or multiple related
topics fields on them.</li>
</ul>
This hotfix also rolls in the fixes previously provided in <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/sharepoint-module-topic-creator-hotfix/" title="Hotfix 1">Hotfix 1</a>, <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/sharepoint-module-hotfix-2/" title="SharePoint Module Hotfix 2">Hotfix 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/sharepoint-module-hotfix-3-now-available/" title="SharePoint Module Hotfix 3 Now Available">Hotfix 3</a>.

<strong>Upgrade Instructions</strong>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/spmodule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.0.Hotfix6.zip">Hotfix6 package</a>.</li>
<li>The package is provided in a compressed ZIP file. Unzip the package on a machine in the server farm. The package contains the following files:

<code>stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPOfficeServer.wsp -filename NPOfficeServer.wsp -local -allowgacdeployment</code><br/>
</li>
<li>Using SQL Server Management Studio or a command-line tool such as OSQL.EXE, execute the SQL script <code>SQLnpsharepoint.sql</code> against the database that holds the topic map(s) used by your SharePoint installation. This will upgrade a stored procedure used by the Search Results Topic List Web Part.</li>
<li>After applying the solution updates it may be necessary to restart IIS.</li>
<li>If you have installed the NPCL Editor Extensions for the TMCore SharePoint Module,
copy the contents of the NPCLEditorExtensions directory to the extensions

</li>
<li>This package also includes all updated documentation in the Doc directory. We recommend that you copy these files over the previously installed documentation files.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="changelog">
<strong>Change Log</strong>
<ul>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed security issue that prevented the NPClassification feature
from being successfully activated through the web GUI in certain
circumstances.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Fixed an issue with the MossAdvancedFacetedSearchWebPart that cause
it to fail to render correctly if no additional fields were configured.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Fixed security filtering issue that caused some rows to be incorrectly
filtered when multiple PSI columns are used. This applies especially
to filtering by the TwoHopQueryWebPart.
</li><li>BUGFIX: TagDisplayWebPart now renders links as full URLs rather than relative
URLs. This fixes a problem where the relative URL path was incorrect
when the web part was placed on the root Web of a site collection.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Fixed Related Topics Field rendering so that it is no longer
language sensitive. There should now be no need to edit
fldtypes_topicmap.xml when deploying to sites using languages
other than English.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Fixed error reporting when a topic map timer job cannot be created
due to missing SharePoint Module base topic types.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Fixed permissions error that prevented users from activating the
NPClassification feature through the browser on a site that uses
forms-based authentication.
</li><li>BUGFIX: The inline selector for related topics fields now includes topics
that do not have a SharePoint URN subject identifier.
</li><li>BUGFIX: The inline selector for related topics fields now shows topics
in ascending alphabetical order.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Activating the NPClassification feature multiple times on the
same site will no longer result in multiple AddSiteUser
timer task topics and will also remove any existing duplicate
timer task topics for that site.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Topic types on the Site Classification page are now shown as
a tree with each level alphabetically sorted.
</li><li>BUGFIX: Search Results Topic List Web Part now hides all result topics
that are not an instance of a type from the NPCL schema. This
prevents users from seeing "infrastructure" topics such as
NPCL types or SharePoint Module Timer Task topics. The web
part can be configured to override this behaviour and show
all topics. NOTE: This update requires a change to the
SQL stored procedures used by the TMCore SharePoint Module.
Be sure to read the <a href="#instructions">upgrade instructions</a> carefully.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Actually there should be no outage, we hope...but its always best to plan for the worst :-)
This weekend (12th-15th December) we will be migrating our mail servers which means there may be a short period of outage. This will mainly affect the web form for requesting product evaluation licenses (which will be disabled for the period of the move) and may also result in messages to support@networkedplanet.com not receiving the normal automated reply.
The plan is that all email should still be delivered to us, but if you send us an email over this weekend and don't get a reply by Monday please try sending it again.

		<title>NPCL Schema Editor Update</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/npcl-schema-editor-update/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2009 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The NPCL Schema Editor is a plugin for Visual Studio 2005 that enables you to create topic map ontologies through a simple graphical interface. The goal of the schema editor is to make it easy for developers or information architects to convert the domain model into a topic maps model. The editor has been designed to be extensible by supporting additional user-defined menu actions and we have separately released a set of extensions to enable the topic map ontology to be mapped against Content Types in a SharePoint site.
Over the last few months that the NPCL Schema Editor has been out we have come across a few issues with installation (especially on Vista / Server 2008 machines) and with our extensions mechanism for the NPCL Schema Editor. This new release of the NPCL Schema Editor fixes those issues.
The main changes are:
<ul>
<li>
BUGFIX: Fixed extension loading code so that a copy of the NetworkedPlanet.Npcl.Vs.Dsl.DLL is no
longer required in the extensions directory. If you previously added this file to the
extensions directory to fix extension loading issues you should now delete that file.
</li>
<li>NEW: The installer now includes policy files so that extensions that targeted version 2.0.0.0
or version 2.0.0.1 of the NPCL Schema Editor will continue to work after an upgrade.</li>
<li>NEW: Added README and INSTALL text files to the release package.</li>
</ul>
The sharp-eyed among you will have noticed that we haven't yet upgraded this package to work with Visual Studio 2008. This is the next thing on the list and will be part of the forthcoming 2.1 release of the schema editor.
You can download the new NPCL Schema Editor from <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/npclschemaeditor/NPCLSchemaEditor-2.0.0.2.zip">here</a>. Please note that if you have a previous version of the schema editor installed you must uninstall that before attempting to install the new version.
I also found a couple of minor annoyances in the SharePoint Module extensions for the Schema Editor and fixed those. The updated extension package can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/npclschemaeditor/sharepointmoduleextensions.zip">here</a>.
As usual if you have any comments or suggestions for improvements or, dare I say it, bug reports please send them to support@networkedplanet.com.

		<title>SharePoint Module User Scraping</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last couple of weeks I've had a lot of queries from developers about the "scraping" that we do to create topics for users in a SharePoint Module topic map. Some confusion has been caused by the fact that we have two ways of doing this and also some concern has been expressed about the amount of logging activity generated in particular by the AddSiteUsers task. This post is a copy of a support response I wrote for the last developer to enquire and I'm posting it here in the hope that it might be useful to others too.
We have two ways of scraping users from SharePoint into the topic map. There is a Topic Map Timer Task called AddSiteUsers, and a feature called NPProfileScraper.
The AddSiteUsers timer task is activated once on each site (SPWeb) where you activate the NPClassification feature. Its job is to ensure that there is a topic for each user that has access to the site, so when it wakes up it checks the SPWeb.AllUsers property and goes through it checking that each user has a topic in the topic map and creating a new user topic if needed. This task is run by the Topic Map Timer Job which you can see when you look at the farm timer jobs in the SharePoint Central Administration app. The Topic Map Timer Job wakes periodically and looks for Topic Map Timer Task topics in the topic map and then runs them one by one.
The NPProfileScraper feature does something similar but instead of using the SPWeb.AllUsers property on each SPWeb, it communicates with the MOSS Profile Service - this is why it is a separate feature (because you cannot install it on WSS 3.0).
In 3.0 and the current 3.1 beta, NPProfileScraper is much more configurable than AddSiteUsers. For example you can set NPProfileScraper to run once every X hours (default is 24) and you can specify the type to assign to the new user topics. AddSiteUsers tasks just run as frequently as the Time Job and because you have one per SPWeb that can be a lot of activity. Currently the only way to stop AddSiteUsers tasks from running is to go into the topic map (the default one you have named in NPSharePoint.xml) and delete all topics that have the name "AddSiteUsers - xxx" where xxx is a site name. Its not pretty but it does work, until someone activates NPClassification again, when the task topic gets created and the whole thing starts again.
In 3.1 we have fixed this by allowing you to configure AddSiteUsers to also run once every X hours (per SPWeb) and to also configure AddSiteUsers to never run.
The logging is another issue. In 3.0 and the early 3.1 betas there was no support for throttling logging like you can with the standard SharePoint logging (e.g. restrict it to logging only Error level messages and above). In the 3.1 release this will be fixed and you will be able to use the SharePoint Central Administration site to set the throttling for a number of different SharePoint Module-specific log categories.
If you are working on a 3.1 beta AND you have your users in the MOSS Profile Service (so NPProfileScraper gets them), then my advice is that you delete all the AddSiteUsers topics from the topic map now and when you get the final 3.1 release make sure that you set the configuration in NPSharePoint.xml to never allow those tasks to run.
If you are working on 3.0 and need a better fix than the workaround described above, please let me know and I'll try and get a new Hotfix out that includes some of the changes we already made in the main development branch of the code.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Topic Map Constraint Language standard, which defines a way to create constraints/ schema for topic maps is moving into the final stages of the ISO process.
This standard is really comprised of two parts; the first is a generic framework to enable anyone to create custom constraints and have them evaluated as part of the TMCL evaluation model. The second part defines around 20 built in constraint types for the most common use cases.
TMCL uses the TMDM to store constraints and thus uses CTM as one authoring syntax.
We will be updating and publishing the TMCL tutorial that we have given several times now, both as a full document and as a series of blog entries.
The editors welcome all comments and feedback, the latest document can be found <a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/tmcl.html">here</a>

		<title>SharePoint Module Known Issue: Topics not created for Pages</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/sharepoint-module-known-issue-topics-not-created-for-pages/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We recently received a bug report from one of our customers about the SharePoint Module not creating a topic when a new page was created in a Page Library. Normally, topics are created whenever an item is added to a list using SharePoint's ItemAdded event. However  in this case the ItemAdded event handler was failing and so the topic was not created. Further investigation revealed that the ItemAdded event handler was not receiving the correct event information - in particular the reference to the new list item was null. This means that our event handler cannot determine the identity of the new list item and so cannot create a topic.
It turns out that this is an issue that has been hit by a number of people and not something directly related to the operation of the SharePoint Module itself. Until Microsoft correct this behaviour the only workaround available for this issue is to edit the item or its properties after creating it. Editing the item will force an ItemUpdated event which does contain the correct event properties and the topic will then be created.

		<title>Enterprise Services Known Issue: Topic Map Index fails to start with error 1075</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of customers have reported an error when starting up the Topic Map Index Service installed by the Enterprise Services 1.0 installer. When trying to start the service, the user will see a dialog displaying a message like:
"Could not start the TMCore Topic Map Index Service service on Local Computer
Error 1075: The dependency does not exist or has been marked for deletion"
What has happened is that the installer detected SQLServer installed on the machine and has inserted the dependency. The dependency it adds is against the normal SQLServer service name, but if you are running a different instance or are running SQLServer Express edition, you will need to modify that dependency.
WARNING: The fix to this problem involves changing registry keys. Please be very careful to change only the specified keys and ensure that you enter the correct values.
To fix this problem you need to first determine the name of the SQL Server Express service to add the dependency for. To do this, look for the server in the services list, then go to the Properties for the service. The service name is the value displayed as "Service Name" on the "General" tab of the Properties dialog. For example, on our own intranet server that uses SQL Server Express, the service name is "MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS".
Now go into the registry, go to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTopicMapIndex and change the DependsOnService value to the name of the database service that the topic map index service should wait for before starting up.
NOTE: If you don't actually connect to a database service on the same machine then just delete this value completely.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the release of version 3.0 of the NetworkedPlanet NPCL Schema Editor and NPCL Tools for Visual Studio.
The NPCL Schema Editor is a graphical editor that runs inside Visual Studio and provides developers with a drag-and-drop interface for creating topic map ontologies expressed in NetworkedPlanet's NPCL format, the format used by the EPiServer Module and SharePoint Module as well as other NetworkedPlanet tools.
The NPCL Tools for Visual Studio provides a bundle of new features to make it easier to work with NPCL files in Visual Studio. The current set of tools are:
<ul>
<li>An MSBuild task for compiling multiple NPCL files into a single NPCL file for easy deployment;</li>
<li>An MSBuild task for generating HTML documentation from an NPCL file;</li>
<li>An NPCL Schema Editor extension that allows developers to add text and HTML documentation to the items in an NPCL schema;</li>
<li>A Visual Studio project template for an NPCL Schema project that uses the MSBuild tasks to create a Visual Studio project for creating a large NPCL schema as a set of smaller, more easily managed NPCL files.</li>
</ul>
Most importantly of all, this new release is built on Visual Studio 2008.
As with previous releases, the NPCL Schema Editor and Tools for Visual Studio are provided free of charge and the latest version can be downloaded <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/npclschemaeditor/npclschemaeditor-latest.zip" alt="Download the NPCL Schema Editor and Tools for Visual Studio">here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[13/02/2009, NetworkedPlanet are pleased to annouce the release of version 3.1 of the TMCore SharePoint Module.
The TMCore SharePoint Module is a tight integration between Microsoft SharePoint and the TMCore information management server that greatly improves the way information is organised, classified and located with Microsoft SharePoint solutions.
This new release sees a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, but more significantly it includes a number of features that have been requested by our customers including support for paged faceted search results and some new facet selectors for faceted search; more flexible auto-classification schemes; and the ability to filter and sort SharePoint lists by the classification information attached to the list items.
The new version is available as an upgrade for all customers with a current maintenance contract. For more information and download details please <a href="mailto:contact@networkedplanet.com">email us</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday at the Topic Maps 2009 conference in Oslo I gave a presentation called 'A Vision for a Topic Maps World'. In this presentation I summarised some of the key successes of Topic Maps and then looked forward to how Topic Maps can work on a more global scale.
One of the key things I presented was a concept for a Subject Identity Resolution service, a kind of DNS for subjects and representations of statements about subjects.
The full presentation can be found <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/vision_for_a_topic_maps_world.pdf">here</a>.
We'll be blogging more about the Subject Identity Resolution Service over the coming weeks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Linked <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/web3_subjects_on_the_web.pdf">here is a white paper that provides a vision and introduction to web3</a>.
The summary below provides an introduction...
In the past 20 years, the Web has developed from a niche technology to a mass-media providing new forms of communication and interaction between people. Web 1.0 was a technical platform - a common set of protocols and formats that allowed machines to communicate and present information from a remote server to a local user. Web 2.0 used the technical platform of Web 1.0 to build more interactive web sites where users contribute and share content and become creators and owners of content rather than passive consumers.
Web 2.0 has reached the limits of what can be achieved on the technical platform of Web 1.0; new technologies must be put in place to provide a fundamentally new technical infrastructure, or platform,  to enable the next generation of innovative web applications. Key to this Web 3.0 platform is a set of protocols and formats that allow the communication of subjects and people's perceptions of those subjects between computers, and that enable new applications to be built that allow users to create, share and integrate information and knowledge seamlessly...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[EPiServer Module 3.3.0.38 has now been released.
This release fixes an issue where unpublished pages when deleted from within EPiServer were not also being removed from the Topic Map. This would cause an already deleted unpublished page to show as a valid association within the Topic Map Editor interface. If you have previously encountered this issue, you must manually remove the topic for the deleted unpublished page as the consistency checker is unable to determine topics that do not have an associated page within EPiServer at this time.
Compatibility with EPiServer CMS 5 R2 SP2 RC has also been tested. We are aware of cosmetic issues with the Topic Map Editor when using Internet Explorer 8 or Firefox however.

The article is
<a href="mailto:http://www.egovernment-computing.de/projekte/articles/188135/">http://www.egovernment-computing.de/projekte/articles/188135/</a>
And, Marc commented that ''you might find this little article intersting that was published without direct intervention from me. Especially the statement from our federal ministry of the interior is astonishingly positive."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we are proud to have launched Subj3ct.
Subj3ct is a Subject Identity Resolution Service, it provides both a portal for humans to use and an API for developers and applications. We store subject identifiers, equivalent identifiers and also links to web resources that contain structured or unstructured information about a subject.
The resolution service is intended to provide services to:
a) people looking to re-use common identifiers in order to improve interchange
b) application developers who are building the next generation of web applications, where dynamically finding and merging linked data is key
We are starting out in gathering mode, trying to get collections of identifiers registered so that we have a useful set of subjects.
Once we have this we will be creating new features and writing more on how to use the service in building Web 3.0 applications.
In the meantime, we would really appreciate it if people can register subject feeds and just generally provide feedback on the portal and API.
Everything can be found at <del datetime="2013-04-03T12:34:53+00:00">https://subj3ct.com</del>
Finally, thanks for all the support and encouragement we have received in putting this exciting service together.
The Subj3ct Team

<strong>EDIT</strong>: Sadly due to constraints of time and money for funding a free service we have had to withdraw Subj3ct from general use.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A small useful ontology and what it tells us about Web3</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Implementing Topic Maps solutions for a variety of people we see many ontologies (information models, domain models, schemas) being used. Out of this we have tried to understand how different approaches are useful for different kinds of customers.
One approach, where the customer is a focused specialist group or small company/department who 'know their stuff' really benefit from having a rich ontology as it says more about what they are doing. These are also the people who want to encode knowledge as something explicit and then use that knowledge as part of the information displayed to users of the system.
At the other end of the scale large organisations tend intially to benefit from a less is more approach. This is typically becuase getting 'political' agreement on what the business does and where the focus should be is much harder at the large scale.
It is this second example I want to pick up on here. The most basic, useful ontology that we see in use consists of just three types; Content, Concept and Person. Concepts can be connected to other concepts as 'broader/narrower' and also 'as related'. Content 'is about' concepts, and 'related to' person. Person can be connected to concepts in a few ways that are often tweaked for the domain. e.g. expert in.
This ontology is not the ultimate base model for explaining everything, but more about being able to usefully cover enough about a domain to promote the things that are important in an information management system. (Things such as faceted search, concept centric, bi-directional linking, multiple names and identifiers. All the findability niceness of Topic Maps.)
This model works well because it has recognised that people and content are two fundamental pillars of the way we work with information. Making the users/ people part of the model is critical to be able to deliver targeted contextualised content. This is the kind of content and knowledge people want to see and have access to.
So now we are moving Topic Maps concepts and approaches from the enterprise to the web and in particular the web3 context how can these ontology lessons inform us about how web3 works and the impact it will have?
Well, the biggest observation is that while web1.0 provides content, web2.0 provides people and content there is an obvious gap and therefor need for the third pillar which is concepts. Having concepts on the web will enable people to group and organise the content around the subjects that are important to them.
Having concepts on the web will provide binding points around which content can be produced and grouped, it will facilitate social networking groups to be organised around concepts. Overall having concepts on the web will provide a new and vast dimension to the experience of using this content management system we call the web.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have just refreshed Subj3ct.com with Beta 2. We have tried to incorporate the feedback we have had as well as adding some things we think are useful. The highlights are:
* Support for OpenID for signing in
* Ability to create and publish identifiers and indicator pages from with the Subj3ct portal
* A changes feed that can be used to aggregate whats happening in Subj3ct
* Embeddable snippets (RDFa, SKOS etc) on each subject record page that can be used to tag a page with a given subject.
* The start of a user community that currently supports user search
* Ability to process SKOS feeds
* Ability to register feeds without creating an account (this allows users to reference existing SKOS vocabularies that they don't own)
* Updated statistics on the home page and quick links to most recent subjects and some random subjects.
* Bug fixes and performance improvements
We now have 3180 identifiers in 23 feeds and we and others are adding to this all the time.
More stuff to come...]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Change Log</strong>
<ul>
<li>BUGFIX: RelatedTopicLinkField and RelatedTopicNameField first save fix (values were only saving
when an item was updated).
NPClassification feature must be reactivated for this fix to take effect.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed an error in ContentTypeCreator.exe that caused feature generation
to fail when a SUBCLASS topic type mapping.</li>
<li>ENHANCEMENT: This Hotfix now includes the updated Enterprise Services version 1.1.0.0</li>
<li>ENHANCEMENT: The npspc.resx resource file has been extended to allow translation for all
custom properties on NetworkedPlanet SharePoint module Web Parts, custom controls
and pages.</li>
<li>FEATURE: A configurable property has been to XSLT based web parts to enable processing of
XSLT scripts.</li>
<li>FEATURE: XSLT based Web Parts now have a new custom property of Max Retries which allow
the Site Administrator to set how many times the Web Part should attempt to retrieve
the Context Topic for the Web Part before showing an error message.
The One Hop and Two Hop Web Parts allow the error message to be configurable through
a custom property on the Web Part itself rather than using the default message set
in the NetworkedPlanet resource file.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Added support for setting the site topic map through the Feature.xml file. Add the
properties shown below to the Properties section of the Feature.xml generated by the
NPCL Schema Extensions Editor.
&lt;Properties&gt;
&lt;Property Key="TopicMap" Value="simpleorg" /&gt;
&lt;Property Key="PropagateTopicMap" Value="false" /&gt;
&lt;/Properties&gt;
The second property, PropagateTopicMap is optional. When it is not present PropagateTopicMap
is set to true and therefore all sub-sites are also set to the specified topic map.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Changed stsadm remapurls command so that the content type mappings are also updated
based on the rules set out in NPUrlMap.xml config file.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: The Topic Type Mapping page on a content type and the Content Type To Topic Types
Mapping Page in site settings now show an error and disable use of the  page when
the occurrence type for content type mapping is not found. Message is to import the
XTM file shipped with the SharePoint Module that contains the types needed.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed a bug that was caused by trying to add a site column of type Related Topic Name
field or Related Topic Link field before any Related Topics fields had been added to
the site's fields collection.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: The interface for adding a new Related Topics field to a content type has been updated
so that it now allows the creation of Related Topics fields for associations whose
schema consists of a single role type that is allowed twice (i.e. with a single association
role constraint with minimum and maximum cardinality set to 2).</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed a rendering error of related topics fields when shown with a SharePoint column description. 			Description now shows on new line.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Replaced missing images in the NPCL Schema Editor Extensions documentation.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Added paths for Windows Server 2008 in NPCL Schema Editor Extensions documentation</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Fixed an bug in the ContentTypeCreator command that caused an exception when generating a
feature from a schema that required the use of a Topic Type Selector field.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: TopicID property was throwing an exception on sealed classes when language was not EN. </li>
<li>BUGFIX: Paged Faceted Search Results Web Part was showing paging information but no result set.
Paging information is now filtered so that if empty records are returned from Enterprise
Services they do not affect the paging labels.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Documentation updates for the Administrators, Site Developers and Web Parts Guides.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Console output of loggers were showing the full trace category rather than the specific
trace category name.</li>

		<title>Implementing Topic Maps Content Management Integration using Atom and Live Mesh</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/implementing-topic-maps-content-management-integration-using-atom-and-live-mesh/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most common scenarios for Topic Maps is to use them as the primary paradigm for organising, classifying and finding content in a content management system. The basic strategy involved in these integrations is to create topics for each content item in the CMS and then associate the content topics to other topics in the the topic map. We call this process  'content item proxification and classification'. This builds up a nice graph that can then be exploited in search and navigation controls either within the CMS or as part of some other publishing process.
The key to making this work is to somehow hook into what is happening within the CMS so that the topic map view of the content items correctly reflects things in the CMS. i.e. if a document is deleted its topic shouldn't show up in the topicmap.
The integrations we have done for EPiServer and SharePoint have taken the approach of event handlers installed into the CMS product. This means that as things happen in the CMS our handlers are notified and can ensure that the topic map is in a consistent state.
However, more and more, we are looking at online content systems, and how to integrate these content stores with Topic Maps systems.The following sections discuss a generic pull approach to synchronisation and then give some detailed insights into implementing this approach with Live Mesh. Live Mesh is an online service from Microsoft for collborating, file syncing and generally supporting dynamic ad-hoc work groups. It is of course missing a powerful metadata management and classification aspect.
OK, so first up is the general notion of a pull based approach to integrating a Topic Maps system with a CMS. This approach was inspired by the TMShare protocol that was developed at CEN. This was an Atom based protocol that published a feed of changes that had occurred inside the system. A client could process this feed to get the current state of each item that had changed. Note: this approach didn't say what had changed, just that a given topic has changed and here was the address of its representation. The client could then update its local store to be aligned with the 'server' node.
So, instead of syncing between two topic maps this approach looks to sync the Atom feed from Live Mesh into a topicmap.
The Live Mesh environment consists of an online virtual folder and file hierarchy and optionally corresponding syncronised folders on multiple devices. However, when synced all the 'actions' performed can be found in an Atom feed for each users' Mesh. The news feed for a Mesh can be found at the following URL (note that the base of the URL will change as this is the CTP):
<code>
https://user-ctp.windows.net/V0.1/Mesh/News
</code>
This feed contains a series of entries. Each entry corresponds to some event that has occurred; such as a file being added or a folder deleted, renamed etc.
Our syncronising application runs as a background process on the users' machine. The process will fetch the feed of events and then update the topicmap accordingly (this topic map could be local or in some online Topic Maps service). In a local TMCore instance I have already set up an ontology consisting of File, Folder, Mesh Space, Concept and Person. The items in Mesh will map to their obvious counterparts in this ontology.
The TMShare protocol provides links to representations of things that have changed. The client is expected to pull the representation and update its local version. Mesh has a more transaction based approach where is lists the actions that have been performed. However, if a client application just sticks to doing changes rather than updating full representations then there is no way for a client to get back in sync if an event is lost or if some events simply are not published (except for an out of bound action). For this integration we consider each event to simply be a notification that a given Mesh entity has been updated / deleted. We then fetch that entity's Atom entry and from that update the topic representation. For most content management integrations we can accept some delay in getting in sync but we would like it to happen.
Drivin the sync process is the News feed. It contains an entry for each event that has occurred. Here is the basic structure of a 'Live Mesh Event Atom Entry':
<code>
&lt;entry>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;id>urn:uuid:2979996d-57a0-e3c7-d7bd-b5f1a2b33bcb&lt;/id>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Contexts>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/NewsItemContent>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/content>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/entry>
</code>
The key things that we use from the above Atom entry is the <b>Title</b> element value. This is the unique key for the event type. I would have preferred to see this implemented a little more robustly, either in a custom attribute/element in the entry or as part of the content. I certainly would have liked to see it as a URI rather than just a string.
The following are the list of event types that can occur in the Live Mesh Environment:
<code>
LiveMesh.FolderRename - Occurs when a folder is renamed (note there is no event created when a LiveFolder is renamed.)
LiveMesh.FolderAdd - Occurs when a new folder is added.
LiveMesh.MemberAdd - Occurs when a member is added to Folder.
LiveMesh.LiveFolderAdd - Occurs when a new LiveFolder is added. Why the need for the special cases? If the scope was set to the Mesh that would be enough.
LiveMesh.LiveFolderDelete - Occurs when a LiveFolder is deleted. Note: no events are raised for all the sub files and folders that are also removed.
LiveMesh.FileAdd - Occurs when a file is added to a folder.
LiveMesh.FileUpdate - Occurs when a file is updated or renamed.
LiveMesh.FileDelete - Occurs when a file is deleted.
LiveMesh.MemberInvite - Occurs when a member is invited to join a folder.
</code>
With the event detected we can then pull information out of the <b>Contexts</b> element. This data structure isn't the cleanest for pulling out the key information but it tells us on which item the event has occurred and in what context (folder). The <b>NewsContext</b> provides links to the items being affected. These items can then be fetched and the state replicated into the topicmap. This includes creating and deleting topics for files and folders, maintaing relationships between files and folders and folders and their parents.
As Live Mesh doesnt raise events for recursive deletes, we fire a pseudo delete event when there is a LiveMesh.LiveFolderDelete event for all descendent files and folders.
All of this processing means we then have a topicmap synced with the state in a given Live Mesh account.
The trade off we see between an event based integration and a pull integration is that the pull integration is more lightweight, robust at dealing with failure, and easier to evolve over time. The value of the integrated event model based approach is that information moves in near real time from the CMS into the Topic Maps system.
So by using the Atom feed of changes to a Live Mesh environment we are able to create and maintain proxy topics for all files and folders. This gives us a baseline on which to build further functionality such as advanced metadata management, classification, search etc.
Now all we need is a nice Silverlight UI to allow users to navigate, query and further classify all their nice Mesh file topics ;)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NetworkedPlanet today announces the release of latest version of the TMCore topic map engine. TMCore is the premiere toolkit for developers on .NET looking to harness the full power of Topic Maps in their applications. Built from the ground-up using .NET technologies, TMCore provides a flexible set of APIs and builds on the robustness, scalability, performance of Microsoft's SQL Server.
The new SP4 release of TMCore07 provides a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements and is a recommended upgrade for all customers. Customers having a current support contract receive TMCore07 SP4 free of charge. For download details please email us at contact@networkedplanet.com.
The following fixes and updates have been made in this release:
BUGFIX: TMEditor now properly displays non-latin characters in browsers that have support for rendering them correctly.
PERFORMANCE: Performance of the stored procedures for duplicate suppression has been greatly increased while also decreasing the amount of server memory required to complete the duplicate removal process on large topic maps.
BUGFIX: TMEditor now supports editing association role constraints for reflexive associations
BUGFIX: The NPCL import process now allows importing duplicate association role constraints on an association. This fix enables users to define reflexive associations using multiple association role constraints with the same role type.
BUGFIX: The tm_npcl* views have been fixed to eliminate duplicate entries and improve performance.
BUGFIX: tmimport.exe and tmexport.exe now return a non-zero status code when an error is encountered.
BUGFIX: XTM export has been fixed to not export associations with no roles in order to avoid generating invalid XTM output.
BUGFIX: The NPCL Forms export has been fixed to avoid generating invalid output when the NPCL schema contains inconsistencies.

		<title>Known Issue: TMCore07 SP4 - Display of non-ascii characters</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/known-issue-tmcore07-sp4-display-of-non-ascii-characters/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2009 09:08:11 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Description</b>
TMCore07 SP4 included a fix for the tm_displayName function in the TMCore database that provides the default display name for a topic. Prior to SP4, this function returned a varchar result which meant that non-ASCII characters would display as a ?. From SP4 the function was updated to return an nvarchar result, allowing any Unicode characters to be correctly displayed. Unfortunately the early release of the SP4 package did not include this updated function in the database upgrade script.
<b>Systems Affected</b>
This problem will show up only on databases that have been upgraded from a previous version of TMCore - clean database installations are not affected by this problem. In addition, the TMCore07 SP4 installer has been fixed so that downloads of the installer taken on or after the 21st August 2009 do not exhibit this problem either for new databases or for upgraded databases.
<b>Fix</b>
If you downloaded TMCore07 SP4 prior to 21st August 2009, you can apply the update  for the tm_displayName function by running the following SQL script against the TMCore database:
<pre>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- tm_displayName
-- Returns a display string for a topic selected from the topics variant names and topic names.
-- Since: 1.0
-- Last Updated: 2.4
if exists (select * from sysobjects
where id = object_id(N'[tm_displayName]') and
xtype in(N'FN',N'IF',N'TF'))
DROP FUNCTION [tm_displayName]
go
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.tm_displayName (@topic int)
RETURNS nvarchar(512)  AS
BEGIN
DECLARE @disp int
DECLARE @ret nvarchar(512)
SELECT @disp = (SELECT TOP 1 topic_id from tm_si
WHERE
tm_si.topicmap = (select topicmapref from topic where id = @topic) and
subj_id='http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/core.xtm#display')
SET @ret = (SELECT TOP 1 variant_value FROM tm_nameVariantValue JOIN tm_variantScope ON tm_nameVariantValue.variant_id = tm_variantScope.variant_id
WHERE
tm_nameVariantValue.topic_id = @topic AND tm_variantScope.scoping_topic_id = @disp
ORDER BY tm_nameVariantValue.variant_id ASC)
IF (@ret IS NULL)
SET @ret = (SELECT TOP 1 name_value FROM tm_nameValue JOIN tm_nameScope ON tm_nameValue.name_id = tm_nameScope.name_id
WHERE
tm_nameValue.topic_id = @topic AND tm_nameScope.scoping_topic_id = @disp
ORDER BY tm_nameValue.name_id ASC)
IF (@ret IS NULL)
SET @ret = (SELECT TOP 1 name_value FROM tm_nameValue JOIN tm_nameScope ON tm_nameValue.name_id = tm_nameScope.name_id
WHERE
tm_nameValue.topic_id = @topic and ((tm_nameScope.scoping_topic_id IS NULL)  or (tm_nameScope.scoping_topic_id = -1))
ORDER BY tm_nameVALUE.name_id ASC)
IF (@ret IS NULL)
SET @ret = (SELECT TOP 1 name_value FROM tm_nameValue WHERE tm_nameValue.topic_id = @topic ORDER BY tm_nameValue.name_id)
RETURN @ret
END
GO
grant exec on tm_displayName to tm_reader, tm_writer
go
</pre>

The focus of this article is on the implementation of the SPARQL query language on top of a topic map repository. I'm not going to get down into implementation issues but instead will describe what has motivated this work and the way in which we have addressed the various incompatibilities between the graph-based data model for which SPARQL was designed and the aggregate association model of topic maps.
</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation and Goals</h2>
<p>The principle motivation behind this work has been the need for topic maps repositories to be active participants in the Linked Data Web. It is relatively trivial to expose topic map data as RDF but just providing a bunch of addressable RDF resources isn't really enough. A true Linked Data repository really must also support a query interface that allows clients to search and filter the data provided by the repository. It is clear (from even a cursory inspection of the various linked data repositories that exist out there) that SPARQL is the preferred query language for Linked Data clients. Therefore if a topic maps repository is to be a full and useful participant in the Linked Data web it is important that it can provide a SPARQL query service endpoint.</p>
<p>A second, weaker, motivation has been the progress and direction of the ISO TMQL standard. At the time of writing the TMQL standard is still under development and while it is not clear just yet exactly how the query language will look, it is my opinion that the final language will not be palatable to those outside the topic maps community. It is hoped that by providing a SPARQL query implementation on top of a topic maps repository it would be possible to provide a simpler query language that perhaps meets the 80/20 rule leaving the 20% of really heavy lifting in topic maps query to TMQL.</p>
<p>The main goal of this project is to enable the implementation of a SPARQL query endpoint, but it is also important that this should be an endpoint that is usable by any Linked Data client. In particular the SPARQL query endpoint should be queryable by a client that does not know (and does not need to care) that the underlying repository is using topic maps as its core data model rather than RDF. Ideally a client should be able to send the same query to both RDF and Topic Maps based repositories and, assuming there is some consistent mapping of identifiers to resources, retrieve equivalent results. For example, if I have a topic map that stores social network data using the FOAF ontology, it should be possible for a client to query that data using exactly the same SPARQL queries it would use to query an RDF store of FOAF data.</p>
<p>We have called this project TMSPARQL.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>A SPARQL query is expressed as a graph pattern that (in its most basic form) consists of a set of triples where the subject, predicate, or object of those triples may be either an RDF node or a variable. The query result returns the collection of bindings of values to the variables that result in a match of the pattern against the data store. TMSPARQL takes a SPARQL query and converts it into a set of matches against a topic map data store. It is important to point out that the data being queried is stored using a conventional topic maps data model - no conversion or intermediate form of data is required nor is any configuration or mapping of identifiers.</p>
<p>For the purpose of explanation I'm going to use some very simple sample data. This is the data being queried in CTM notation:</p>
<pre>
person http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/person .
company http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/company .
worksFor http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/worksFor .
employer http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/employer .
employee http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/employee .
hourlyWage http://www.networkedplanet.com/ontology/employment/hourlyWage .
alf
isa person
hourlyWage 14.50 .
bert
isa person
hourlyWage 25.40 .
xyz isa company .
worksFor(employee: alf, employer: xyz)
worksFor(employee: bert, employer: xyz)
</pre>
<h3>Mapping URIs to Topics</h3>
<p>The first stage of the TMSPARQL process is to bind all URIs in the triples of the graph pattern to topics. The URI may be one of a small number of special predefined URIs (primarily used as predicates for explicit traversals of the topic map data model), otherwise the URI is used to look up topic map items by item identifier or subject identifier (for topic items). Under this rule it is possible for a single topic to be referenced by different resource URIs in a SPARQL query, but this has no negative effect on the construction or execution of queries. If a topic map item cannot be found for a particular URI, then the triple containing that URI cannot be matched. For example given the query:</p>
<pre>
PREFIX ont: <http://www.networkedplanet.com/simpleOntology/>
SELECT ?person ?employer ?wage WHERE {
?person ont:employer ?employer .
?person ont:hourlyWage ? wage
}
</pre>
<p>only the predicates of the triples in the graph pattern are bound to URIs. The TMSPARQL engine must, then, find the topic map items identified by the URIs <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/simpleOntology/hourlyWage</code> and <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/simpleOntology/employer</code>.</p>
<h3>Implicit Data Model Traversals</h3>
<p>If the predicate of a triple in the SPARQL graph pattern does not match any of the predefined URIs for the explicit data model traversals, then there are a number of possible traversal options that the TMSPARQL processor must consider. In each case, the predicate specifies a typing topic that acts as a filter on the traversal.</p>
<h4>Related Topics Traversal</h4>
<p>The related topics traversal binds topic items to the subject and object of the triple. The predicate of the triple must be a role type and specifies the type of the role played by the topic bound to the object of the triple in an association in which the subject of the triple plays a role of any type other than the type bound to the predicate. In our example query the triple <code>?person ont:employer ?employer</code> executes a Related Topics Traversal because the topic with subject identifier <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/simpleOntology/employer</code> is used as a role type in two associations in our sample data set.</p>
<p>At first glance it may be unclear why the predicate is a role type and not an association type. The reason for this is that a topic map association potentially groups more than two topics together. Using the association type as a filter implies no specific "direction" to the triple meaning that any role player could be bound to either the subject or object of the triple and that all possible combinations would have to be returned by the match (in our example if we used association type as the predicate <code>?person ont:worksFor ?employer</code> and would result in the following matches:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>?person</td><td>?employer</td></tr>
<tr><td>alf</td><td>xyz</td></tr>
<tr><td>xyz</td><td>alf</td></tr>
<tr><td>bert</td><td>xyz</td></tr>
<tr><td>xyz</td><td>bert</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The predicate is specified to be the type of the role played by the topic that binds to the object of the triple to make queries read more naturally. If we had said that  the predicate should be a filter on the type of role played by the subject of the triple then our sample query triple would have to be rewritten as <code>?person ont:employee ?employer</code> - which doesn't quite read correctly.</p>
<p>This implied traversal is really tuned specifically for the case of binary associations (as our experience is that the vast majority of all associations are binary). It also neatly handles the case of grouping associations where one player plays a specific "parent" role type and all other players play the same "child" role type. It doesn't quite so neatly handle associations that contain more than two types of role as the subject of the predicate must bind to all players of roles other than the role type specified in the predicate. This problem can often be mitigated by introducing other filtering triples into the query (e.g. adding a ?person a ont:person triple to the query pattern), or if all else fails by falling back on a more verbose use of the explicit traversals.</p>
<p>Using our example data, the query:</p>
<pre>SELECT ?person, ?employer { ?person ont:employer ?employer }</pre>
<p>will result in the following variable bindings:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>?person</td><td>?employer</td></tr>
<tr><td>alf</td><td>xyz</td></tr>
<tr><td>bert</td><td>xyz</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Topic Property Value Traversal</h4>
<p>The Topic Property Value Traversal binds topic items to the subject of the triple and literals to the object of the triple. The triple predicate must be a name or occurrence type and specifies the type of name or occurrence that must be present on the topic bound to the subject with a literal value equal to that bound to the object. </p>
<p>In our example query the triple <code>?person ont:hourlyWage ?wage</code> executes as a Topic Property Value Traversal because the topic with the subject identifier <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/simpleOntology/hourlyWage</code> is used as an occurrence type in our sample data set.</p>
<p>Using our example data again, the query:</p>
<pre>SELECT ?person, ?wage { ?person ont:hourlyWage ?wage }</pre>
<p>will result in the following variable bindings:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>?person</td><td>?wage</td></tr>
<tr><td>alf</td><td>14.50</td></tr>
<tr><td>bert</td><td>25.40</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Handling Traversal Options</h4>
<p>It should be noted that it is not possible to determine from the predicate URI of a triple which implicit data model traversal should be followed. Our current implementation uses the other triples in the query to help narrow down the traversal options. For example the single triple in the query:</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?wage WHERE {  ?person ont:hourlyWage ?wage }
</pre>
<p>Could be either a related topics traversal (in which case ?wage must bind to a topic) or a topic property value traversal (in which case ?wage must bind to a literal). However the query:
</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?wage WHERE {
?person ont:hourlyWage ?wage .
?wage a ont:monetaryValue
}
</pre>
<p>has a second triple that implies that ?wage cannot be a literal value (because it has a type specified by the topic referenced by ont:monetaryValue) so only a related topics traversal is appropriate. Alternatively the query:</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?wage WHERE {
?person ont:wage ?wage .
FILTER (?wage > 50)
}
</pre>
<p>uses ?wage in a filter comparison with a numeric which therefore implies that ?wage must be bound to a literal value and so the traversal in the first triple must be a topic property value traversal.</p>
<p>If the predicate is already bound to a topic at query time, it is also possible to handle this problem by inspection (looking at the topic map to see how the topic that binds to the predicate is used for typing purposes) or by reference to a TMCL schema (by looking at how the predicate topic is declared for use in the schema). However these approaches do not help when the predicate of a triple is itself a variable. In some cases it may be necessary to execute both traversal options and combine the results.
</p>
<h4>Explicit Data Model Traversals</h4>
<p>TMSPARQL predefines a number of URI identifiers for specific traversals of the topic maps data model. Whenever a triple is encountered in the SPARQL query that uses one of these URIs as the predicate of the triple, then the corresponding data model traversal is invoked. Each of these traversals also imply a restriction on the type of item referenced by the subject and object of the triple. The table below summarises these predicates using CURIEs where the prefix <code>rdf</code> maps to the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code> and the prefix <code>tms</code> maps to the URI <code>http://www.networkedplanet.com/tmsparql.</code>
</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>Identifier (CURIE)</td><td>Traversal Description</td><td>Subject Item Type</td><td>Object Item Type</td></tr>
<tr><td>rdf:type</td><td>The type-instance traversal. From a typed topic map item to the topic(s) that specify its type(s).</td><td>Topic, Association, Role, Name, Occurrence</td><td>Topic</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:reifier</td><td>Item -> Reifier traversal. From a topic map item to the topic that reifies that item.</td><td>Association, Role, Name, Occurrence</td><td>Topic</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:role</td><td>Association -> role traversal. From an association item to its child role items.</td><td>Association</td><td>Role</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:player</td><td>Role -> player traversal. From a role item to the topic item that is the value of the role player property</td><td>Role</td><td>Topic</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:topicProperty</td><td>Topic -> occurrence or name traversal. From a topic item to its child name and occurrence items</td><td>Topic</td><td>Name, Occurrence</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:scope</td><td>Scoped item -> themes traversal. From a scoped topic map item to the topics in its scope property.</td><td>Association, Name, Occurrence</td><td>Topic</td></tr>
<tr><td>tms:value</td><td>Property -> value traversal. From a name or occurrence item to its value literal.</td><td>Name, Occurrence</td><td>Literal</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It is important to note that these traversals also carry implications on the type of object referenced by the subject and object of the triple. If a variable is present in multiple triples in the pattern its actual item type must be the intersection of all item types implied by the triples it is in. If that intersection is the empty set, the query cannot bind the variable at all.
</p>
<h4>Importing RDF and Querying with TMSPARQL</h4>
<p>One of the goals of this design has been to make it possible to import RDF into a topic map store and then execute the same SPARQL query against it as you would if the data had been stored in an RDF store. This is the reason behind the choice of the implicit traversals described above. A number of papers on importing RDF into topic map data stores have been written (and many of which are summarised in the W3C Working Group Note "A Survey of RDF/Topic Maps Interoperability Proposals") and it is not the purpose of this paper to rehash those issues. However our design of the implicit traversals does impose some restrictions on how RDF properties map to types in the topic map data store. If the object of the RDF triple is a resource, then the assumption is that the subject and object of the triple both map to topics in the topic map store, and the predicate URI must be the subject (or item) identifier of the topic that defines the role played by the topic mapped to the triple object in an association with the topic mapped to the triple's subject. If the object of the RDF triple is a property, then the assumption is that the subject of the triple must be imported as a topic in the topic map store, the predicate URI must be the subject (or item) identifier of the topic that defines the type of a new property on the topic mapped to the subject of the predicate and the object of the triple must be used as the value of that new property. An ontology-based mapping approach such as Ontopia's RTM should have no difficulty in meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that TMSPARQL doesn't care about any reverse mapping from the topic map back out to RDF, as SPARQL results sets are simple tabular values. Where a variable binds to a topic map item, the TMSPARQL implementation simply returns a suitable identifier for the item (typically a system-specific item identifier). Of course those identifiers should then be resolvable to return RDF data, but how that RDF data is generated is not constrained by TMSPARQL itself. It should also be noted that the CONSTRUCT form of SPARQL query can be used by SPARQL clients to define exactly what RDF the SPARQL endpoint returns.
</p>
<h2 id="limitation">Limitations of TMSPARQL</h2>
<p>Many of the limitations of TMSPARQL are actually limitations in SPARQL itself. For example, querying for the non-presence of specific topics is not terribly easy requiring some contortions with the bound() filter. Reification isn't handled natively (because it isn't handled natively in SPARQL despite the fact that RDF makes heavier use of reification than topic maps). As we chose not to extend SPARQL syntax, if you want to do more with your topic map than traverse related topics and filter on / retrieve type and property information you are force to use some "magic" identifiers - but we feel this is a worthwhile trade-off for interoperability.
</p>
<p>
The TMSPARQL language as presented here does not have direct support for variants (this is due to the mapping performed in our underlying topic map system that converts names, occurrences and variants into "topic property" items). A truly TMDM-compliant version of the language might add support for variants by adding a tms:variant predicate type and defining an appropriate traversal (from name item or variant item to variant item).
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
TMSPARQL shows some promise for helping topic map repositories easily act as full citizens on the Linked Data Web providing a SPARQL query endpoint which, with only a little careful ontology mapping can be made to appear exactly like an RDF data store. The advantages here are primarily for the consumers of linked data - giving them only one query language to learn (SPARQL) and the ability to combine query results from both topic maps and RDF repositories as well as the various databases and other data stores that now expose SPARQL endpoints.
As well as the obvious interoperability benefits, TMSPARQL is also a clean small query language that is relatively easy to learn to write and to reason about which, we hope, should be able to cope with the majority of real-world topic map query use cases.
</p>
<h2 id="examples">Further Examples</h2>
<p>Here are a few additional sample queries to give a feel for how SPARQL can be used to query a topic map. For compactness I haven't included the PREFIX declarations.</p>
<h3>Filtering Values</h3>
<p>The FILTER construct in SPARQL can be used to restrict the results set in various ways. E.g.</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?age WHERE {
?person ont:age ?age .
FILTER ((?age<40 && ?age > 18) || (?age = 50))
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all people aged between 18 and 40 or exactly 50 years old.</em></p>
<p>SPARQL includes a number of predefined filter functions including URI validation and regular expression pattern matching. E.g.</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?website WHERE {
?person ont:web ?website .
FILTER isuri(?website)
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all ont:person topics with an ont:web property whose value is a URI.</em></p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?site WHERE {
?person a ont:person
OPTIONAL {
?person ont:website ?site
}
FILTER (regex(?site, "^http://"))
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all ont:person topics with an ont:web property whose value starts with the string "http://".</em></p>
<h3>Optional Matches</h3>
<p>The OPTIONAL construct in SPARQL means that not all variables need to be bound by a pattern match:</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?site WHERE {
?person a ont:person
OPTIONAL {
?person ont:website ?site
}
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all topics of type ont:person and return the value of their ont:website property if they have one.</em></p>
<p>The OPTIONAL construct can also be combined with the bound() FILTER function:</p>
<pre>
SELECT ?person ?site WHERE {
?person a ont:person
OPTIONAL {
?person ont:web ?site
}
FILTER (!bound(?site))
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all topics of type ont:person that do not have an ont:website property.</em></p>
<h3>TMDM Queries</h3>
<p>Using the special predefined TMSPARQL predicates it is possible to query the topic map data model at a more detailed level. </p>
<h4>Reification</h4>
<pre>
SELECT ?ageProperty ?ageValue ?ageReifier WHERE {
?ageProperty a ont:age .
?ageProperty tms:value ?ageValue
OPTIONAL { ?ageProperty tms:reifier ?ageReifier }
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all names and occurrences of type ont:age, returning the item itself, the value and the reifying topic of the property if it is reified.</em></p>
<h4>Associations</h4>
<pre>
SELECT ?assoc, ?assocType, ?roleType WHERE {
?assoc a ?assocType .
?assoc tms:role ?rolePlayed .
?rolePlayed tms:player inst:12345 .
?rolePlayed a ?roleType
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all associations in which the topic identified by the CURIE inst:12345 is a role player, returning the association item, the association type and the type of role played by the inst:12345 topic.</em></p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<pre>
SELECT ?place, ?name WHERE {
?place a ont:place .
?place tms:topicProperty ?prop .
?prop a tm:displayName .
?prop tms:scope lang:de
}
</pre>
<p><em>Find all topics of type ont:place that have a property of type tm:displayName scoped by lang:de.</em></p>

	<li>ENHANCEMENT: Url Mappings can now feature more than one publish URL for a web application by using
the zones set up when extending the SharePoint web application.</li>

TMCore is the premiere toolkit for developers on .NET looking to harness the full power of Topic Maps in their applications. Built from the ground-up using .NET technologies, TMCore provides a flexible set of APIs and builds on the robustness, scalability, performance of Microsoft's SQL Server.

The new SP5 release of TMCore07 fixes a packaging issue found with the SP4 release that may prevent the faceted search features of the TMCore SharePoint Module from working correctly. Customers having a current support contract or currently evaluating TMCore may receive TMCore07 SP5 free of charge.

This hotfix updates the File Version of the NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint assembly to 2.1.6.0 - if the file version shown is greater than or equal to 2.1.6.0, then you do not need to apply this hotfix.

<strong>Pre-Requisites</strong>

Upgrade to TMCore07 SP5 (if running an earlier version) to avoid issues with faceted search components in the SharePoint Module.
<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em;">Upgrade Instructions</h3>
1. <a title="NetworkedPlanet SharePoint Module 3.1 Hotfix 6" href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/SPModule/NetworkedPlanet.SharePoint.3.1.Hotfix6.zip">Download the Hotfix 6 package</a>.
2. The package is provided in a compressed ZIP file. Unzip the package on a machine in the server farm.
3. Upgrade the NPSharePoint.wsp solution. The exact command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but will be similar to:
<pre style="font: normal normal normal 12px/18px Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">stsadm -o upgradesolution -name NPSharePoint.wsp -filename NPSharePoint.wsp -allowgacdeployment -allowcaspolicies -local</pre>
4. Restart IIS and Windows SharePoint Services Timer
<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em;"><strong>Change Log</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>ENHANCEMENT: Optimized update of associated topic fields to reduce the number of database writes required when saving a SharePoint list item.

Added more logging of SharePoint object close and disposal.</li>
	<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added check to ItemUpdated event receiver to check whether a double event was caused by a check-in. If so, do not do processing for check-in events.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Amended the site deletion code so that topics for sub sites are correctly marked as superceded if the site is the root site of a site collection. This allows the WebCleanUp timer task to successfully remove any topics of the superceded sites on its next run.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Site deletion - if a site deletion fails in SharePoint for any reason, the WebCleanUp 	timer task that runs 2 minutes after the delete event will now also check whether the site still exists and if so set the psi back to PUBLISHED.</li>

		<title>Web3 and Concepts for SharePoint 1.0 Releases Now Available</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/web3-and-cfs-1-0-release/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2010 08:58:31 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of the 1.0 release of our Web3 Platform and Concepts for SharePoint products.

The Web3 Platform is our "next-generation" structured information server built on the foundation of topic maps but with support for Linked Data standards including RDF and the SPARQL query language. The Web3 Platform provides a fully-featured REST API making it possible to create applications in almost any programming language and to quickly and easily integrate structured information into existing applications and websites. The Web3 service provides full support for the topic maps data model and support for browsing content as Linked Data RDF as well as providing a SPARQL endpoint that implements support for querying topic map data as RDF as well as querying at the detailed topic map data model level.

Concepts for SharePoint is simply the best way to organise, search for and find content on a SharePoint 2010 server. It integrates with and extends the taxonomy features of SharePoint 2010, allowing users to create richly interconnected data models that reflect the business in which they work. Unlike the tags in a standard SharePoint 2010 taxonomy, the concepts in Concepts for SharePoint can be made available as published pages complete with links to other concepts and to related content across the whole SharePoint server.

		<title>Using HTTP Verbs to describe Server Side Transactions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the challenges of putting together a REST service is how to let clients make transactional updates that involve two or more resources. One approach to this problem is to create a resource that is 'a collection of transactions'. A client can post a representation of a new transaction to this resource. The transaction becomes a 'child' of the 'transactions' resource and can be accessed via a returned URL.

Making the transaction explicit is good as it allows the transaction to be addressed and its status checked, it also allows for the service to return immediately and process the transaction in the background.

This basic pattern is good but it has a drawback in that for each different system you build you need to define the transaction language.

Our solution to this is to use HTTP verbs, URIs and resource representations as the building blocks of our transaction language. A transaction representation contains a number of operations. Each operation contains information about its Method, e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE, the resource URI to operate on and the request body.

&lt;transaction&gt;

&lt;operation id="a1" method="POST" Resource="http://...../somecollection"&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;!-- resource representation --&gt;&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/operation&gt;

.. more operations

&lt;/transaction&gt;

The server processes a transaction by looking at each operation construct and operating on it as though the request has come from a client. The only difference is that all of the operations listed occur in a single transaction.

Each operation has a local id. When an operation completes the return URL from the operation is bound to that identifier. The identifier can then be used later in the transaction. This is especially useful when you want to create two new resources and then associate them together all in the same transaction.

After a transaction is processed the representation can be retrieved. The representation contains the URLs of newly created resources, as well as an errors information that occurred when processing the transaction.

This is a very powerful model that removes the need to create a domain specific transaction language for different applications, can reuse  existing resource processing code and is very descriptive.

For more information about this approach, download and review the REST service documentation for the <a href="/solutions/web3-platform">Web3 Platform</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Using PowerShell To POST Data to Web3</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it is useful to be able to use PowerShell to manipulate a Web3 instance - either because you are scripting a set of batch operations or because you are just in PS at the time and it saves swapping contexts.

POSTing data to a REST service with PS is really easy, the only small wrinkle with Web3 is the need to authenticate with the server. Assuming you are using the default Windows Authentication setup for your Web3 server, the following set of commands should get the job done:

$wc=New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$cred=Get-Credential
$wc.Credentials=$cred
$wc.UploadString($URI, $CONTENT)

The Get-Credential cmdlet will pop-up a dialog prompting for your username and password - if anyone knows of a way to avoid that please let me know! If you need to load the content from a file, use the Get-Content cmdlet.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are putting together a series of short videos that show how to do different things with the Web3 Platform and Concepts for SharePoint. The first of these videos, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKkbV6lXqNE">Web3 Platform Getting Started No 1.</a> is now available.

The Web3 Platform is a complete data driven environment. This means that with no code you can create a data model and immediately begin to add data either through the generated UI or via the RESTful interface. The first video shows how to create a simple schema using the Silverlight editor and then create topics and associations through the schema driven editor.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>REST in the Web3 Platform</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/rest-in-the-web3-platform/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:16:59 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the goals of the Web3 Platform was to adhere to as many of the architectural principles of REST that was possible. In our minds the key things were that:

1) Given a start URI and a description of all the content types and valid transitions a client could interact with the topic map store.

Yep, there is only that one point.  

Given the URI of a topic map a client that is aware of the different content types that can be returned can interact with the entire topic map without guessing at, or constructing URIs.

For the Web3 Platform we introduced a new syntactic representation for Topic Maps because XTM is an interchange syntax for Topic Maps and not an effective Hypertext representation for the TMDM.

I'll walk through some interactions starting from a topicmap URL to demonstrate why we introduced the new syntax and how a client behaves.

Starting with the topicmap URL:

[code]
GET http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b?format=xml
[/code]

When addressing Web3 Resources content negotiation can be done through accept headers or via  a format parameter. The above GET returns the following representation.

[code]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TopicMap xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
          Id="e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b" 
          Version="49" 
          LastModified="2010-09-22T08:44:56.65" 
          Address="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b" 
          WebLabel="myfilms" 
          Reifier="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/75746aa2-61a1-4303-9d4e-d9832e366e82"
          Schema="http://localhost/web3/schemas/0df562f3-f86b-4fbb-a4d3-66679f2df0fa" 
          Associations="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/associations" 
          Topics="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics">
  <Labels>
    <Label Lang="en-gb">Films</Label>
  </Labels>
</TopicMap>

[/code]

There are a couple of things to notice in this representation.
<ol>
	<li>We use full URLs for everything, no Ids that need turning into URLs based on some defined URL space.</li>
	<li>We are exposing the collections of Topics and Associations as resources in their own right. This allows clients to POST to these collections to create new Topics and Associations and also to fetch these collections. (The full representation documentation also specifies the allowed query parameters for these resources).</li>
</ol>
Now a client can navigate the topic collection using:

[code]
GET http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics?format=xml
[/code]

This returns the following collection:

[code]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TopicRefList xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
              Start="0" Count="29" Length="25" 
              ListUrl="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics" 
              Next="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics?skip=25&amp;take=25" 
              Previous="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics?skip=-25take=25">
  <Items>
    <TopicRef Address="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/2a8a2182-f8b7-427a-9f7f-ef206b775606">
      <Labels>
        <Label Lang="en-gb">Harrison Ford</Label>
      </Labels>
      <Identifiers />
    </TopicRef>
    <TopicRef Address="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/dee5c82f-a6ab-4dcc-9e2b-4fbfcaefdc41">
      <Labels>
        <Label Lang="en-gb">Witness</Label>
      </Labels>
      <Identifiers />
    </TopicRef>
    <TopicRef Address="http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/fc914a45-915c-49b1-baa8-8cf523de3425">
      <Labels>
        <Label Lang="en-gb">Star Wars</Label>
      </Labels>
      <Identifiers />
    </TopicRef>
  </Items>
</TopicRefList>
[/code]

The interesting things in the snippet above are:

<ol>
<li>We have introduced a generic list container for topics, in fact topic refs. This gives us control over thing like collection size and paging.</li>
<li>We have introduced a lightweight topic reference structure for use in listing topics. This is a subset of the full topic representation and is used in many places.
<li>We are explicit about the topic's web address.</li>
<li>We provided explicit links to navigate through the collection</li>
</ol>

All of the above means that a client who understands this content type can navigate to a topic, and find more results or the previous page of results. 

Following a link to a topic using:

[code]
GET http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/2a8a2182-f8b7-427a-9f7f-ef206b775606?format=xml
[/code]

Returns the following XML

[code]

Points of interest in the above snippet are:

<ol>
<li>The link to the associations for the topic. With this we have created a resource that can be navigated to return the associations in which the topic plays a role. (There are optional query parameters on this as well.)</li>
<li>We use inline topic ref elements to minimise round trips for common things, such as property types and topic types.</li>
<li>All contained resources, property (is name or occurrence) and identity expose their web address. </li>
<li>We have also included version information to help with ETag processing.</li>
</ol>

Finally, following the associations link using:

[code]
http://localhost/web3/topicmaps/e518129d-b458-4171-99cc-5e4941dafc7b/topics/2a8a2182-f8b7-427a-9f7f-ef206b775606/associations?format=xml
[/code]

We get back the following XML structure:

So the key things we wanted to do was to create a set of content types that along with a description allowed a client to interact with a Topic Map without the need to refer to or know how to generate ANY URIs.

The examples above have shown how we have updated the core TMDM items, topic, association, occurrence etc to be better REST citizens, and we have also introduced new resources for collections of things in the topic map model. These collections are key to connecting together the basic topic map building blocks.

The full content type descriptions, including update semantics, are available as part of the documentation for the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/solutions/web3-platform/" title="Web3 Platform">Web3 Platform</a>. You can request an evaluation copy of the software <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/" title="Request Evaluation">here</a>.

We also recently posted about <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/using-http-verbs-to-describe-server-side-transactions/" title="Using HTTP Verbs to describe Server Side Transactions">how we support transactions in a RESTful way</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Web3 1.3 Javascript Patch</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This notice applies to all editions of Web3 version 1.3.20317

A couple of Javascript issues with the new Topic Map Editor in Web3 have been brought to our attention.
<ol>
	<li>The Types list in the topic editor does not list topic types which are subtypes of an abstract type. This problem prevents the user from adding a subtype of an abstract type to the list of topic types and it also means that when editing a topic which is an instance of a type that inherits from an abstract type, the editing process actually deletes the topic type.</li>
	<li>The Date/Time field validation doesn't work correctly with the JSON date/time values generated by the Web3 server. This problem shows up when the user enters a valid date/time string into a date/time field and saves the value. The value is correctly stored on Web3, but when the user reloads the topic into the topic editor the field shows the date/time as "NaN-NaN-NaN NaN:NaN:NaN" and displays a validation error.</li>
</ol>
These issues are addressed in a JS file patch which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/download.aspx?file=web3/1.3.20317/web3_1.3.20317_jspatch.zip">here</a>. To install the patch, unzip the file to a temporary directory and then copy the two Javascript files inside it to the directory Serverjs under your Web3 installation directory (typically c:Program FilesNetworkedPlanetWeb3) - these files will replace the two existing Javascript files that contained the errors described above.

Please note: after the update, your browser may still use a locally cached version of these scripts. To ensure that you are using the updated version of the scripts it may be necessary to clear your browser cache.

If you have any problems with this update or other issues with Web3 please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@networkedplanet.com">contact us</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Web3 1.4 Release</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.4 of Web3. This release is a bug-fix update and is recommended for all users of Web3. For a link to the upgrade package please contact us at support@networkedplanet.com.

<strong>Upgrade Instructions</strong>

To upgrade from Web3 1.3, unzip the installation package and run the  installer application in Web3/setup.exe. During installation you will be  prompted for database and service configuration information as you were  during the initial installation. After installing Web3, you should also  upgrade the Web3Admin package on any client machines that use the  Powershell administration snap-in. Full installation and upgrade  information can be found in the installation package.

To upgrade from previous versions of Web3, follow the upgrade instructions above and then open the Web3 site in your browser. Each topic map on the Web3 site must be resynchronized with its schema (if it has one). To do this, click on the topic map name in the topic map list and then on the topic map page click on the Jobs button. On the topic map jobs page, click on the Synchronize Schema button to start the synchronization process. It is also possible to perform this synchronization operation using the Web3 Admin powershell snap-in. Further details on the upgrade process can be found in the README file contained in the installation ZIP package.

<strong>Change Log</strong>
<ul>
	<li>FEATURE: Topic and associations retrieved as XTM now include an automatically generated item identifier based on the Web3 internal GUID identifier for the item.</li>
	<li>FEATURE: Added support for the "no" language code for Norwegian in addition to the existing "nb" (for Bokmal) and "nn" (for Nynorsk)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>FEATURE: The New-Schema cmdlet has been updated to provide better feedback when the command files due to missing files or server errors.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed an editor issue where topic types that were derived from abstract types could not be selected as the type for a topic instance.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: The Get-Schema cmdlet has been renamed to Export-Schema for consistency. This cmdlet has also been fixed to ensure that only the XML format is retrieved from the server.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed a browser caching issue that prevented the browser from displaying the updated topic types after synchronizing schemas.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed a typo with the documentation of the New-Schema cmdlet which showed the command in the command summary as "Add-Schema".</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed bug in client-side javascript library that prevented editing of date/time fields.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed alt-text of the Edit button on the schema display page.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Changed the Javascript library function for testing if an item is in an array to avoid a name clash with SharePoint's Javascript libraries.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed an issue with parsing schema files that include white-space around type subject identifiers.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed problem with SPARQL FILTER clauses not being consistently applied in certain queries.</li>
	<li>BUGFIX: Fixed bug in client side javascript utility for comparing objects.</li>
</ul>
We would like to thank those developers and users who took the time to report issues to us for fixing in this release.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Concepts for SharePoint 1.4 released</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/concepts-for-sharepoint-1-4-released/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 10:44:57 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

Version 1.4 of Concepts for SharePoint is now available. This package addresses a small number of bugs and enhancements. The full change list and upgrade instructions can be found below. 

New customers can <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/request-evaluation/" title="Request Evaluation">request an evaluation</a>. Existing customers with a valid support contract should contact support@networkedplanet.com for a download link.

<strong>Upgrading instructions</strong>
------------------

Unzip the download package and run the STSADM -upgradesolution command.  The exact command-line you use will depend on how you want to schedule the upgrade, but will be similar to:

stsadm -o upgradesolution -name ConceptsForSharePoint.wsp -filename ConceptsForSharePoint.wsp -allowgacdeployment -local

Restart IIS and the SharePoint 2010 Timer Service

If running CfS on a separate server to that of the Web3 Platform, you will also need to upgrade the additional web3.wsp file contained in the upgrade package and restart the services.

For full upgrade and usage instructions, please refer to the documentation contained in the downloaded package

<strong>Change Log</strong>
----------

ENHANCEMENT: Allow the filtering of items returned by the ContentQueryWebPart by SharePoint content type

ENHANCEMENT: performance improvement by removing unnecessary topic reference look ups

ENHANCEMENT: Any field internal name can be set on the ContentQueryWebPart to be used as the value for the title displayed in links. If empty the Web Part uses the item's display name

BUGFIX: Changes to timer jobs to ensure that jobs do not continue to attempt to run on sites which have been deleted

BUGFIX: Changes to feature deactivation to ensure that all jobs are properly removed when CfS is deactivated and removed

BUGFIX: Allow TopicMapAddress property to be set on web parts that inherit from the ContentQueryWebPart

BUGFIX: Concept page links in the ContentQueryWebPart were incorrect when on subsites

FEATURE: concept pages can now load topics based on the term ID from the SharePoint term store as well as the standard topic id, address or psi

BUGFIX: Changes to the topic caching to also cache topics by PSI in addition to topic address

ENHANCEMENT: Changed the ContentQueryWebPart to return documents as well as SharePoint list items by default

BUGFIX: SharePointTaxonomyHelper class was closing an SPWeb object that may be needed in the current context for future use

BUGFIX: Added a new handler that ensures that the event handlers required for concept link fields are added to any new subsites created after the initial activated of CfS. This means that CfS will not be required to be reactivated on new subsites

BUGFIX: Fixed bug in Concepts for SharePoint Licensing which caused an intermittent error being thrown: "handle is invalid"

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If when trying to delete topics in the Web3 Platform causes an error message '405 method not allowed' to be reported, this is most likely due to the WebDAV module being installed in IIS. WebDAV is not supported by the Web3 Platform and should be removed from the IIS site.
To remove WebDAV, open the site in the IIS Features panel and open the Modules feature. Select the WebDAV module if it is installed and choose the Remove action. Restart the site and check that topics can now be deleted.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Web3 2.0 Javascript Hotfix</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/web3-2-0-javascript-hotfix/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A new hotfix for Web3 2.0 has just been released to correct some problems with cross-browser compatibility in the topic map editor application. This hotfix addresses the following issues:
<ul>
	<li>BUGFIX: Editing hierarchy subject identifiers in IE9 was resulting in an invalid URI as the behaviour of that browser is to wrap strings recognized as URLs in an HTML &lt;A&gt; tag.</li>
	<li>FEATURE: Added facility for deleting a hierarchy definition from within the Topic Map Editor. This can be accessed by selecting the hierarchy from the Hierarchies panel and then clicking on the trash-can icon at the top of the middle panel. Deleting a hierarchy definition removes only the definition, not the associations that make up the hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Download</h3>
The new hotfix can be downloaded from <a title="Download the Hotfix" href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/download.aspx?file=web3/2.0Hotfix1/Web3_2.0_ServerHotfix.zip">http://www.networkedplanet.com/download/download.aspx?file=web3/2.0Hotfix1/Web3_2.0_ServerHotfix.zip</a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Download the hotfix ZIP file using the link above.</li>
	<li>Unzip the file to a temporary directory.</li>
	<li>The hotfix consists of two directories of files - css and js. Copy these two directories to the Web3 server directory (typically C:Program FilesNetworkedPlanetWeb3Server), overwriting the contents of the existing css and js directories.</li>
	<li>After applying this hotfix a client browsing the site may need to use a force refresh (ctrl-F5 or ctrl-R) to ensure that the browser picks up the updated Javascript and CSS.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Relevant Versions</h3>
This hotfix is only provided and test for Web3 2.0.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was privileged to be one of the attendees of the Open Data on the Web workshop organized by W3C and hosted by Google in London this week. I say privileged because the gathering brought together researchers, developers and entrepreneurs from all around the world together in a unique mix that I'm sure won't be achieved again until Phil Archer at W3C organizes the next one.
In the following I have not used direct quotes from those named as I didn't make many notes of direct quotations. I hope that I have not misrepresented anyone, but if I have, please let me know and I will fix the text. This is not a journalistic report, its more a reflection of my concerns through the prism of a lot of people way smarter than me saying a lot of interesting things.

<strong>Sustainability</strong>

The workshop was kicked off by John Sheridan reminding us that to build anything of permanence one needs to get the fundamentals right - providing for discovery (a topic that was to come up again and again during the workshop); cementing our offerings so that people can have confidence not only in the data itself but also in our commitment to sustaining that data.

Sustained data publishing was another topic that came up in several talks. In John's talk he asked us if we would be willing to mortgage our house to start a business based on the current crop of open data. While some brave souls have done just that, there is a general feeling that there just is not the confidence in the sustained availability and maintenance of open data. As Alvaro Graves commented later in the day, publishing data is like having children, you can't just push it out of the door and leave it to get on with its life, you have a commitment to it (another analogy that resonates more with geeks like me is to open source - a successful project involves far more effort than simply putting source on GitHub; you have a commitment to documentation, updates, support for your users and development of new features).

One of the issues highlighted, again by Alvaro, is the current trend of releasing data created through hackathons, which tends to promote the one-off data dump model that makes the data less suitable for building on. Possible solutions to this problem were a little thin on the ground. John Sheridan suggested that there probably exists a spectrum of solutions from a community-driven data publishing effort at one end, through institutional commitment and contracts, to legislative / statutory backing at the other end. There was much talk of the role that government has to play in getting this commitment to sustainability off the ground. Governments tend to have control over critical information infrastructure (mapping data, data about core service provision, address data etc); and tend to have data that needs to be updated or reported on on a regular cycle. Both of these factors make governments amongst the first institutions that should be leaned on to make a sustained commitment to publishing open data. I feel it is our responsibility as a community of evangelists and developers to get the right tools into the hands of potential consumers of that data, and those tools should have some means of providing feedback to the data publishers - there needs to be a virtuous circle, where data publishers are recognized for their contribution and get visibility on the value they enable as a means to encourage them to continue publishing data.

<strong>Make It Simpler ?</strong>

Another key theme that took me somewhat by surprise was a number of speakers advocating for open data to be published in simpler formats: by which I think all meant CSV. For Mark Birbeck, the challenge was not so much getting data into RDF but getting data that aligns consistently (in terms of the coding for time frames, geospatial references etc). Mark also pointed out that tabular data such as CSV is far easier to process with line-oriented tools and also with data analytics tools such as Hadoop. Rufus Pollock from the Open Knowledge Foundation and Omar Benjelloun from Google both presented data packaging formats (Simple Data Format and DSPL) both of which seek to make collections of tabular data available in a downloadable package that includes metadata. Meanwhile on the same panel Stuart Williams of Epimorphics was valiantly putting the point that in some cases the metadata, especially provenance metadata can not only dwarf the data itself, but is fundamental in determining the confidence that can be placed in the data.

In the two days of the workshop I saw as much effort expended on the question of "simply" publishing CSV data as on almost any other aspect of linked open data on the web. I find that a bit disheartening, it feels like the community is actively making a retrograde step. I have nothing against the publication of CSV as a stop-gap measure to address the need for open data, but I worry that the amount of attention this issue receives from the Linked Open Data (LOD) community detracts from other, equally important issues and will send the message that CSV is OK for LOD. There are undoubtedly some who believe this to be the case, but I am totally unconvinced that CSV is a suitable format for *linked* open data.

<strong>Data As A Service</strong>

This discussion around CSV packaging and publication and other discussions during the workshop raised another interesting question that I haven't really spent a lot of time considering and that is the tension between offering data as a resource and offering data as a service. When I'm putting together demos or looking for data to hack I often want to get a data dump, pull all the data onto my machine where I can run it through the processes I want to apply to it. When I just want to look something up (say in MusicBrainz or DBPedia) however, I'll use SPARQL - I don't want gigabytes of RDF data on my machine to answer a query like "who played in the Grateful Dead". There seemed to be some doubt about whether data that sits behind a service can be trusted to be as sustainably available as data available as a dump. In fact it was a question put to me after my presentation on OData / SPARQL interoperability. The fact that the data is accessed by a query API means that the consumer is dependent on the server for continued access to data. It was suggested that if you are building a business based on using data behind a service you don't control you may feel nervous about that. However, I feel that there are two strong counter arguments:
<ol>
	<li>There are well-understood mechanisms for reducing that nervousness - distribution / mirroring of popular services is one; service level agreements for commercial access to data services is another.</li>
	<li>The web already consists of any number of applications that depend on big third-party APIs such as Flickr and Twitter. The fact that you can't get a data dump of tweets or photo metadata doesn't seem to have prevented people building applications and even businesses on these APIs.</li>
</ol>
In fact, this issue with data services is basically just a reformulation of the need for sustainability and the points made by John Sheridan that I outlined at the top of this piece. I don't see the "download it all to my machine" as a scalable solution - it doesn't scale up to handle terabyte science data and it doesn't efficiently scale down to enable true semantic web applications for smaller devices. Effective distributed query *has* to be the way that LOD moves to ubiquitous consumption - we aren't there yet, but if we want to keep our eyes five or ten years forwards then we can't be thinking of solutions that rely on local mash-ups of data dumps. Even in the here and now, we heard from a number of presenters that providers of open data want to be able to measure the impact and usage of their data. This, I think, could tend to preference data services over data dumps due to the quality of usage data that monitoring service API accesses can provide. That said, there is a role for both properly packaged data dumps and open data services and perhaps publishers should be considering more carefully if their data dump should be accompanied by a SPARQL and/or OData endpoint, and if their data services should be accompanied by raw data dumps. I detected a undercurrent of insistence that data behind a service API is not "open" - I believe that is wrong, and dangerously so.

<strong>Discoverability</strong>

Omar Benjelloun from Google in his presentation also made the point that data sets need good web pages. To which I can only say "amen" - too many data sets that are near impossible to find through web search engines and despite the efforts of CKAN a directory of open data is always going to be hard to maintain and to scale. If we are publishing data on the web, lets make sure that it is discoverable. Aggregators such as CKAN help to some extent but web-scale discoverability can only be quickly achieved by leveraging the existing web-scale search infrastructure. Christopher Gutteridge from Southampton University raised some interesting concerns around the trustworthiness of data discovered through uncritical web crawling, but I think that adopting the sort of practices he advocates for double checking whether data found within a domain is truly sanctioned by the domain owner may prove to be critical, especially when applications are automatically discovering data sets.

<strong>Attribution &amp; Licensing</strong>

This is one of those can of worms areas that (a) is more a social issue than a technical one and (b) is probably not going to get a lot of attention because, quite frankly most people find it boring. However its a critical component of LOD that will only cause greater problems the longer it is left to fester. Leigh Dodds has already done some initial research and thinking in this area and outlined some of the issues. The issues in this area that interest me are:
<ul>
	<li>Would it be possible to simplify open data licensing through a Creative Commons-style approach of defining a set of licenses with a well-defined set of attributes to them that can be used to govern how data is attributed and linked to and uses to which it can be put ?</li>
	<li>What does it mean when a consumer of LOD publishes another data-set derived from one or more source data-sets. Are data licenses viral ? What level of remixing is sufficient for a work to count as a new unique work ? I am sure that there is precedent in offline publishing and online content publishing - the question is are such precedents appropriate ? Will we need to test this in case law (as was suggested by Bob Schloss from IBM in a different session).</li>
	<li>What does it mean when a consumer of LOD publishes an application that internally makes use of one or more data sets or a data set synthesized from one or more data sets, but does not display the data (for example using Wordnet in a natural language interface)</li>
	<li>How can we make a solution scale for:
<ul>
	<li>Applications that make use of hundreds or thousands of data sets</li>
	<li>Applications that discover data sets at run-time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>And there was so much more</strong>

Writing up the last of these notes on the train on the way home from the workshop I am both frazzled and buzzing. In the last 48 hours I have learned about stuff that I want to emulate, things that I need to make sure go into our products and things that are just going to worry me for years to come. In these 2000 words, I feel I have really only scraped the surface and I'm sure that there was a load of stuff that just went completely over my head. I'll leave it to others to fill in all the gaps I have left in my truly partial account of an amazing event.

The agenda for the day, along with links to the papers and presentations are all available <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/04/odw/">here on the W3C website</a>. My own presentation on OData/SPARQL interoperability is also available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NetworkedPlanet/o-data-sparqlinterop">here on Slideshare</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NetworkedPlanet Announce BrightstarDB Commercial Support</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last year and a half, the founders of NetworkedPlanet worked together on building <a href="http://brightstardb.com/">BrightstarDB</a>, a unique native .NET triple store with support for MVC application models and LINQ. BrightstarDB was released a couple of months ago as an <a href="https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB">open-source project on GitHub</a> where we continue to work on extending and improving it. We hope that being open-source with a very permissive MIT license will enable .NET developers to experiment with and use BrightstarDB in all sorts of projects, large and small. However, we realize that for some projects the lack of commercial support for a component such as BrightstarDB can be a deal-breaker.

So from today we are happy to announce that NetworkedPlanet will provide commercial support contracts for BrightstarDB. Our support contract provides you (or your customer) with direct email support from developers working on the BrightstarDB code base. We can provide priority bug-fixes, patches and even feature enhancements for commercial support customers. A commercial support contract also helps to directly fund our work on BrightstarDB.

In addition to support we are happy to offer training and consultancy around BrightstarDB and the technologies it supports. Many .NET developers are still unaware of RDF and Linked Data and we provide training courses and materials specifically in these areas and are happy to tailor training courses to your specific requirements.

For more information about our offerings, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@networkedplanet.com">contact@networkedplanet.com</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After attending a very engaging and interesting talk given by <a href="http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/gshort/">Gary Short</a> at <a href="http://www.dotnetdevnet.com/">Bristol's DotNetDevNet</a> group, I decided to have a play around with two tools that he showed us for querying and visualizing data in Microsoft Excel.

These tools are <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379">Power Query</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38395">Power Map</a> for Excel. They are free add-ons for Office 2013 and Office 365. It's unclear whether they will continue to be available for Office 2013 (currently you can download the previews) or whether they will be only available for Office 365 in the future, so to be on the safe side install them now to have a play around with them.

I'm going to do a quick walkthrough of the demo we were shown by <a href="https://twitter.com/garyshort">Gary Short</a> at his <a href="http://www.dotnetdevnet.com/Meetings/tabid/54/EntryID/80/Default.aspx">Introduction to Data Science</a> talk.

First of all we need some data that we can use that will be easy to view in the mapping visualizations; the datasets available at <a href="http://data.police.uk/data/">data.police.uk</a> have a perfect type of data for our purposes: types of crimes reported in various locations over time. I selected a year's worth of data for the "<em>Avon and Somerset Constabulary</em>" and downloaded it to my computer.

The data is given in CSV files; annoyingly with multiple folders each with a single CSV file, and then the bundle zipped for download - so you will need to do a bit of rearranging of files to collect them into a single folder. You can then merge the files using the command line using the command
<pre>copy *.csv [[new-filename]].csv</pre>
<em>(Remember to remove the duplicate headers from the merged file)</em>

Make sure you have installed Power Query and Power Map, and then open Microsoft Excel and open a new blank workbook. Click the "POWER QUERY" tab in the ribbon, and have a look through the "Get External Data" section. We're going to be importing data from a file, but as you can see there's some very interesting options available to us in the "From Other Sources" list, including the option to import from an OData Feed, a SharePoint List, Facebook and Hadoop just to name a few.

Importing data from our merged CSV file is very simple, select "From File" and "From CSV"

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1354" alt="powerquery1" src="/assets/images/2013/07/powerquery1-660x371.jpg" width="660" height="371" />

Many of these columns are not needed for our visualizations, so we use this Power Query tool to remove columns that we don't need, right click on the column header and select "Remove" on Crime ID, Reported By, Falls Within, Location, LSOA Code, LSOA Name and Context. If you want to see the query that has been generated by the tool, then you can click on the Setting button and select "Show Formula Bar". Then click "Done". Excel quickly pulls all the data needed using the query into the Excel workbook.

To make use of the second tool mentioned, Power Map, click on the "Insert" tab of the ribbon, and select Launch GeoFlow from the Map button. Select the Latitude and Longitude columns for the geography and then hit "Map It" to load the data onto the map visualization. You can then select "Crime Type" and "Month" to produce visualizations such as this:

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1365" alt="map1" src="/assets/images/2013/07/map1-660x462.jpg" width="660" height="462" />

Then just start playing around with the tool to see what you can do! Hit the "play" button to show the data being added over time, or change the Chart Type to show data in a different way.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1367" alt="map2" src="/assets/images/2013/07/map2-660x462.jpg" width="660" height="462" />

These new tools from Microsoft really do make merging and querying data extremely easy, and the powerful visualizations from Power Map can be produced quickly and with minimum fuss but incredible results.

The demonstration of these tools was obviously only a tiny segment of Gary Short's much longer talk on An Introduction to Data Science, so do follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/garyshort">twitter</a> or have a look at his <a href="http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/gshort/">blog</a> to find out more.

		<title>Loading data from SPARQL Endpoints into Excel Power Map</title>
		<link>http://www.networkedplanet.com/loading-data-from-sparql-endpoints-into-excel-power-map/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following on from the previous post about <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/visualising-data-in-excel/">Visualizing data in Excel</a>, I decided to have a look at how easy it would be to load data from a SPARQL endpoint into an Excel Power Map.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/">SPARQL 1.1 supports a return format of CSV</a>, which makes it straightforward to write a query that returns a useful set of data to load into Excel.

DBpedia has various resources that contain longitude and latitude data, and has a very handy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql">SPARQL endpoint complete with query editor</a>, so the first thing to do is to write a query to return data that shows people's birth places over time.
<h3>Writing the query</h3>
Load the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql">DBpedia SPARQL Query Editor</a> in your browser, and set the results format to HTML. This will display the results in the same webpage in an HTML tabular format so that you can adjust your query before downloading any CSV. Enter the SPARQL shown below into the Query Text field.
<pre>select distinct ?p ?name ?dob ?birthPlace ?lat ?long where {
?p a dbpedia-owl:Person . 
?p foaf:name ?name . 
?p dbpedia-owl:birthDate ?dob .
?p dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?bp . 
?bp a dbpedia-owl:Settlement .
?bp foaf:name ?birthPlace . 
?bp geo:lat ?lat . 
?bp geo:long ?long . 
}
LIMIT 250</pre>
This returns resources of type dbpedia-owl:Person whose birth place was of type dbpedia-owl:Settlement (to narrow down the birth place to as specific an area as possible). The query also returns the name and date of birth of the person, and latitude, longitude and name of the birth place.

Viewing this in the browser we can see a number of duplicates, and for the purposes of this example we'll narrow the data to those in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. To do this, amend the query to the following:
<pre>select distinct ?p as ?id SAMPLE(?name) as ?name SAMPLE(?dob) as ?dob SAMPLE(?birthPlace) as ?birthPlace SAMPLE(?lat) as ?latitude SAMPLE(?long) as ?longitude 
where {
?p a dbpedia-owl:Person . 
?p foaf:name ?name . 
?p dbpedia-owl:birthDate ?dob .
?p dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?bp . 
?bp a dbpedia-owl:Settlement .
?p dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?bp2 . 
{ ?bp2 dbpedia-owl:country dbpedia:United_Kingdom } UNION { ?bp2 dbpedia-owl:country dbpedia:Republic_of_Ireland } . 
?bp foaf:name ?birthPlace . 
?bp geo:lat ?lat . 
?bp geo:long ?long . } 
GROUP BY ?p 
LIMIT 1000</pre>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1423" alt="html" src="/assets/images/2013/07/html-660x337.png" width="660" height="337" />

Click "Run Query" to check the results, and then up the LIMIT to 250000 and set the Results Format to CSV. This will download a file named "sparql" to your computer. Go to the downloaded file and rename it to <strong>dbpedia_personbirth.csv</strong>.
<h3>Loading and viewing the data</h3>
<em>Before opening Excel, make sure you have <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/visualising-data-in-excel/">installed Power Query and Power Map</a> as explained in the previous blog post.</em>

Open Excel, click the Power Query tab and select Import &gt; From File &gt; CSV and open <strong>dbpedia_personbirth.csv </strong>in the Query Editor.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1380" alt="import" src="/assets/images/2013/07/import-660x474.png" width="660" height="474" />

&nbsp;

Our SPARQL query was very selective when returning variables, so we don't need to remove any columns from the import query, so click "Done".

Wait for the data to load completely, and then click "Load to Data Model" in the Query Settings section, after this is complete, open the Insert tab and hit the GeoFlow &gt; Map &gt; Launch GeoFlow. This launches a new Power Map Tour window, and clicking on the <strong>latitude</strong> and <strong>longitude</strong> columns autofills the options in the "Geography" section ready to hit "Map It"

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1383" alt="powermap1" src="/assets/images/2013/07/powermap1-660x382.png" width="660" height="382" />

Once the data has been mapped we can see some strange data, namely the points of red over in the USA and elsewhere on the globe (shown below); very strange considering the data was filtered to the UK and Ireland! But we'll come back to that later as we can see that the majority of the data is indeed on the British Isles.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1384" alt="mapit" src="/assets/images/2013/07/mapit-660x488.png" width="660" height="488" />

Now that the data is mapped, select <strong>dob</strong> which is entered into the "Time" field and then change the Chart Type to "HeatMap".

As Power Query recognises that the <strong>dob</strong> field contains dates, it converts them to Date types in the Excel workbook. Power Map in turn recognises the date fields, and when it is selected loads the field into "Time" - this also displays a floating date display over the map, and adds playback controls to the bottom of the screen.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1407" alt="playback control" src="/assets/images/2013/07/Capture-300x62.png" width="300" height="62" />

Press the Play button to start the data visualization and you will see the map changing over time as pinpoints are added to the heatmap as the data loads another person's date of birth, and adds the location of their birth place to the map (as shown in the screenshots below).

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="1" src="/assets/images/2013/07/1-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="2" src="/assets/images/2013/07/2-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="3" src="/assets/images/2013/07/3-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="4" src="/assets/images/2013/07/4-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="5" src="/assets/images/2013/07/5-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" alt="6" src="/assets/images/2013/07/6-300x222.png" width="300" height="222" />

<br class="list" />
Following the steps above shows how you can easily query data from a SPARQL endpoint, and then quickly load and manipulate the data (if required) using Excel Power Query, and then view that data using Excel Power Map.

&nbsp;
<h3>Investigating Strange Data</h3>
As mentioned above, when the data was first loaded into Power Map - we can see some pinpoints outside of the UK, which are not expected given that the query is written to filter down to only UK results. To check out these pin points of confusing data, we can load the <strong>id</strong> field on the Power Map. Loading every ID slows down the visualization tool significantly, but is worth doing for investigation into the the odds lines of data. Zooming in on a pin point in the USA and clicking on the pin point (when the chart type is set to "Column") displays the information of that point, and we can type the ID shown directly into our browser to load up the page in DBpedia.
For example, one of the points of "bad data" near Chicago shows the id
<pre>http://dbpedia.org/page/Bill_Brennan</pre>
Loading this up in the browser shows that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Bill_Brennan">Bill Brennan</a> has multiple possible birth places of Chicago, and County Mayo, Ireland. This may simply be that the person's birth place is not actually known.

Clicking on the point of data with the earliest birth date is surprising, as instead of showing a Roman Emporer or similar, instead the ID was shown for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Chris_Smalling">Chris Smalling</a>. Going to the resource page for Chris Smalling shows his birth data as 22nd November 0198. An obvious data entry/clean up error as the dbpprop property shows the birth date as 22nd Nov 1989.

This shows how loading data into a visualization tool can help us spot "bad" data very quickly and investigate it, without having to read hundreds of lines of text on a spreadsheet.
<h3>Troubleshooting dates in Power Map</h3>
Whilst writing this blog post I had trouble replicating the stages of loading the data into the Power Map as there was a problem with the <strong>dob</strong> field. Excel Power Query was not converting any dates with a year previous to 1900 properly for use in the playback Time field in the visualization. The solution to this problem was to click the <strong>Load to Data Model</strong> option after the data had initially loaded from the CSV file, and before loading the data to a Power Map. The post above has been updated to include this step.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have just added a new page to the site detailing the pricing levels for <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/support/brightstardb-support/" title="BrightstarDB Support">commercial BrightstarDB support</a>. 
<!--more-->
We have tried to provide a cost-effective support offering that can suit small teams and scale up to encompass larger teams. Our basic support is charged per named contact rather than per developer in your team - so if you have 10 developers in the team but only two working on the BrightstarDB back-end, then you only need two named contacts on your support contract or you can opt to have just one of the developers as a support contact.

At the high-end of the support offerings we have our extended support program which adds a number of hours of consultancy or bespoke development to the package.

For full details, please go to the <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/support/brightstardb-support/" title="BrightstarDB Support">BrightstarDB Support</a> page.]]></content:encoded>

The new TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 release supports EPiServer CMS 7.5 bringing the power of concept-based findability and navigation to EPiServer sites. The tightly integrated topic editor component makes it easy for editors to create relationships between pages as part of the normal page edit / update cycle and an extensive API allows developers to create uniquely flexible site navigation of related pages and related concepts. Please note that this release is compatible only with EPiServer CMS 7.5 - customers on older versions of the EPiServer CMS do not need to upgrade at this time.

The TMCore07 SP7 release has been issued in tandem with the TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 release. This release includes some minor bug fixes plus compatibility fixes to enable newer browsers to access all of the features of the TMEditor web application. This is a recommended upgrade for all TMCore users.

Both the TMCore EPiServer Module 7.5 and TMCore07 SP7 are available now to customers with an active support and maintenance contract - please <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/contact/" title="Contact">contact us</a> for download and upgrade details.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Open Data Musings</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I've been chatting to a lot of different people about the benefits of Open Data. One question that seems to crop up again and again is simply <i>why </i>open up the data they have collected to publish on the web?

It’s the question that is at the root of it all when it comes to changing how proprietary people feel regarding their organisation’s data.

Just yesterday I was talking with a friend who has been working in computing since the 80′s and during the 90′s was head of IT in a university department. She told me of meetings they had with the head of departments and leaders in the university management when the World Wide Web was new. The meetings were to discuss the benefits of creating one of these new-fangled websites for the university.

The management team were in general supportive of the idea, but had some questions that fell into two key areas:
<h3><b>A feeling of loss of control</b></h3>
How could they see who was reading the information? Contact with potential students and other academics happened person to person and could be given as feedback to management so that they would know what people were asking for. If they put information on a website, would the web visitors simply come and go without ever making “real” contact with the university, and they would never know whether the person’s questions had been answered or not.

Of course, as time went on they found that providing information on a website cut down on the amount of time administration staff had to spend dealing with duplicate queries about the same subject. The website provided points of contact which funneled queries to the right departments, and new questions prompted new content on the website.
<h3><b>Unsure of the wider benefits</b></h3>
How would anyone find the information? This was at the very early stages of the World Wide Web, at the time of the meeting this was before search engines and organisations provide index pages to navigate the collection of web pages that they had written.

Seeing the potential benefits of publishing information on web pages, they pushed ahead along with other early adopters of the Web. As more and more web pages were added, programmers developed search engines which made a huge difference to finding information on web pages. The more information was published on the Web the more it pushed new technologies to be developed: search engines being the most game-changing of these, but also user friendly reporting of the visitor logs and searches used on web sites allowed content creators to gain insight into what their visitors needed.

I could carry on and talk about how years later companies would open up their functionality with APIs and allow other organisations to make use of funky tools on their own websites such as embedded image galleries or maps, or images pinpointed on maps! That came later, all of what I’ve spoken about happened in the 90′s, I’m talking about initial advancements such as search engines and web analytics that wouldn’t have been developed if the content hadn’t been out there to search for.

The similarities of that meeting to the recent discussions I've had about Open Data certainly didn't escape me!

Before I get going, I am at no point talking about <i>personal </i>data. The type of data I’m talking about would more accurately be defined as research data.

Changing your mindset from keeping raw data locked away to publishing it as Open Data can be difficult to imagine when the concept is relatively new. One of the points I try to reassure people about is that no one is suggesting you dump every bit of data you own onto a public website! In the same way that that university didn’t suddenly publish every piece of information they had for students, you can look at your data and think about what would be useful to be provided openly. A good starting point is the data used in any reports that you make public. After all, you must want that information out there and people making use of it, otherwise - why spend time on publishing reports, or papers, or whatever other formats of data you already make public?

Why do it at all? I hear you ask. One simple word:
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.2em;"><b>Collaboration</b></p>
As more raw information is opened up and published as Open Data, the more it pushes new technologies and applications to be developed by the wider Web community of developers and researchers.

Data from different sources can be pulled together to be shown in new and interesting ways, whether that’s by developers who want to simply provide a useful tool, or academics who are going to be able to push research forward in a field that you care about.

Open Data will drive the next generation of applications in the same way that simply publishing text on web pages drove the formative technologies on the World Wide Web.
