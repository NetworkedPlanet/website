            Concepts for SharePoint makes it possible to integrate a complex domain knowledge model into the standard Microsoft SharePoint Managed Metadata System (MMS).

    <p>SharePoint MMS has two major weaknesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is restricted to simple hierarchical relationships, making it impossible to represent complex concept-to-concept relationships. Like the folder structure of a computer file system, a hierarchy of concepts forces you to put a concept under one place and one place only. However, in reality concepts have a web of different relationships.</li>
        <li>The terms in the SharePoint MMS are not independently browesable. When a user tags a document with a term from MMS, the tag is available only as text. It is not possible for a user to see other content tagged with the term or to see the relationships between terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With Concepts for SharePoint, rather than using the SharePoint MMS to capture the domain knowledge model, you develop your knowledge model in Web3 making use of your own domain-specific <a title="Ontology" href="/glossary/ontology/">ontology</a>. Concepts for SharePoint then automatically synchronizes the concepts you define into SharePoint MMS as a series of hierarchical term sets.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Concepts for SharePoint automatically reflects concepts defined in Web3 into the SharePoint MMS. These automatically generated MMS terms can sit alongside other manually created terms &#8211; allowing you to combine a structured domain knowledge with user-generated tagging.</li>

        <li>The automatically reflected MMS terms are linked back to the Web3 concept and its complete set of properties and semantic relationships.</li>
        
        <li>Every concept has its own customizable Concept Page. This is a page that is accessible by clicking on an MMS term that is linked to a Web3 Concept. The page displays not only the results of searches in SharePoint for that term, but also information from Web3 about the concept and its related concepts. A Concept Page becomes a hub page for all information related to a particular concept.</li>

        <li>Concept Pages are normal SharePoint page content, this means that they can be included in SharePoint&#8217;s full-text search index. This enables users to search on a concept and find the relevant Concept Page hub, rather than just finding a list of documents which may or may not be truly related to the term they searched on.</li>

        <li>Concepts for SharePoint provides a custom field control to allow MMS terms that are linked to Web3 concepts to be rendered as links to the relevant concept page. This means that a user viewing the tags for a document or other piece of content in the SharePoint portal can click on any term to go to the hub page for that term.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Software Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft SharePoint 2010 or 2013</li>
