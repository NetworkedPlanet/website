As a service to the Third Sector (not-for-profits, charities, and social enterprises), NetworkedPlanet is offering a series of free workshops. No formal presentation is planned, but professionals evaluators and analysts will be on hand to assist participants with programme evaluation plans, statistical questions, analysis, database set-up issues, and data protection guidance, and more.

Bring evaluations with which you are struggling or funding applications and a laptop, and we will work together to move your project forward.

This free event is hosted by NetworkedPlanet at Campus London. The workshop is open to all charities, NFPs, Social Enterprises and voluntary sector organisations.
