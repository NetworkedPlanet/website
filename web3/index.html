<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="lead">Web3 is a unique platform for building all kinds of applications driven by a flexible semantic data model.</p>
<p> At the core of Web3 is full support for the ISO Topic Maps standard, an international standard for the representation of knowledge models. Web3 also adds support for managing RDF data and for reflecting Topic Maps as RDF - enabling applications to take full advantage of the more comprehensive Topic Maps model while still participating in the Linked Data web.</p>

<p>The Web3 Platform removes the complexity of managing and publishing semantic data by providing a set of <a href="/glossary/rest/">RESTful services</a>, integrated security, a complete publishing model and enterprise features such as persistent caching and reliable message queue for notifications.</p>

<p>The Web3 Platform is ideal for Rich Internet Applications, Enterprise and Public Linked Data, Enterprise Information Integration, Enterprise Taxonomy and Master Data Management, and Concept-Driven websites.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p><strong>Schema-less Data Storage</strong>: The ability to store data of any shape without the need to involve a database administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Loose Schema Coupling</strong>: Schemas are used to define how a semantic store should look but they do not prohibit non-schema conformant data being added.</p>
<p><strong>Service APIs</strong>: A complete set of RESTful APIs for creating and managing schemas and data.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Security Model:</strong> All access and update capabilities are based on user access rights. The Web3 platform integrates with Active Directory and ASP.NET role providers.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Scaling:</strong> The Web3 platform has elastic capabilities where new nodes can be added as required. Each additional node can process transactions, handle queries and publish data.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Caching:</strong> The Web3 platform employs a persistent cache to allow large amounts of data to be quickly available. The cache invalidation architecture ensures that cached representations are cleared when the underlying data is updated.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Robustness:</strong> The Web3 platform uses transactional updates for making data store changes. Information about changes is published to one or more persistent Microsoft Message Queues. Clients can then use this information to drive client applications.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Integration:</strong> As well as supporting semantic technologies such as RDF and Topic Maps the Web3 platform also provides complete support for the Sd-Share standard. This is an ATOM based protocol for the syndication and synchronisation of multiple semantic stores.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Data:</strong> The web is changing from a web of html to a web of data. The Web3 platform has support for publishing Linked Data.</p>
<p><strong>SPARQL:</strong> The Web3 Platform provides support for querying the underlying semantic store using the SPARQL query language.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing:</strong> The Web3 platform is about publishing knowledge and provides a default publishing model and the ability to refine and develop custom publishing solutions. It completely separates data from presentation.</p>
