Data teams come in various shapes, sizes, and forms. Whether a department of professionals for gathering data and analysing it for insights, or small teams of service providers learning how to collect data and present basic findings, we can advise and support your team.
 
We offer full consultancy, technical services, and training.  For larger teams, we can introduce new technology that will allow the better use and management of data and integration with open data.  

For smaller teams, we offer training in accessing and using open and linked data, and support for funding agencies, which allows linkage of data between many organisations.

[Email our team](/contact) to find out more or set up a meeting.
