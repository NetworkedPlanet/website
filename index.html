					<p class="lead">We are passionate advocates of Linked Open Data.</p>
					<p class="lead">We believe that publishing Open Data helps organisations build trust through transparency and gain leadership by publicising their knowledge.</p>
					<p class="lead">We believe that by linking Open Data we can together create a true Web of Data with possibilities beyond our imagining.</p>

                <p>Using existing Semantic Web standards, the Data Platform makes it simple to manage and host your data and provides an themeable interface for users to browse hosted datasets.</p>

                <h2>BrightstarDB</h2>
                <p>BrightstarDB is a native .NET RDF triple store with some unique features that make it the ideal platform for developing
both Linked Data applications and generic applications that require a flexible schema-free approach to storage in a .NET
environment. BrightstarDB was created by the founders of NetworkedPlanet and is now an open-source project.</p>

				<h2>Concepts for EPiServer</h2>
				<p>Like many web content management systems, EPiServer manages the pages of a site in a strict hierarchy with limited tagging support for managing other groupings of pages. With Concepts for EPiServer it is possible to use an existing domain knowledge model to structure the content of and access to a web site; or as a way to better index and organize existing site content.</p>

					<h2>Consultancy</h2>
					<p class="lead">
						NetworkedPlanet can provide your organization with the help and support necessary to kick-start the process 
						of building a domain knowledge model; or creating linked open data.</p>
					<p>Our approach focuses on getting the details about the domain or the source data out of the heads of the domain experts and into a form that can be expressed visually and clearly documented as a first step to building a knowledge structure or planning a data extraction and transform. This approach is independent of any final implementation (whether it is with NetworkedPlanet’s tools or with other tools).</p>
					<p>We can also help with the technical aspects of implementation using our products, giving you the advice and support you need to make the best use of Data Platform, BrightstarDB, or Web3 and its related products, in your projects. In addition we can develop bespoke solutions and integrations that meet your needs.</p>
