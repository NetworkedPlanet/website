## DataDock - Free Linked Open Data Publishing

DataDock is a free open data publishing service that automates the creation of an open data portal in a matter of minutes. Using github to host the raw data and static web pages, DataDock comes with a set of features that puts paid-for open data publishing platforms to shame.

### Feature List:

* Free Account
  * DataDock accounts are free of charge.
* Individual and Organisation accounts
  * Publish data to your individual repositories or to an organisation's repositories from your user dashboard.
* Unlimited Datasets
  * We set no limits to the amount of datasets you can publish as open data.
* Add Dataset Information
  * Also known as "metadata" - add titles, descriptions, and keywords to your published datasets to make them easier for others to find and use.
* Automatic Data Portal
  * Publishing data via DataDock automatically creates a dual-reader data portal - one that is human-readable and uses cutting edge web standards for machine-readable data portal content
* Search For Published Data
  * Search other people's datasets by the keywords used by other data publishers.
* Open Licenses
  * Every dataset is published with a license to make it officially licensed open data.
* Data Downloads
  * Anyone can download your published datasets as complete CSV data files.
* Web of Data Integration
  * Your DataDock portal consists of pages for each of the records in your datasets, this means every record is now addressable and live on the Web of Data. This allows for advanced interlinking of data from different sources - and achieving 4 star open data, link your data to others to achieve the full 5 stars!
